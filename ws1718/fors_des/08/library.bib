 abstract = {This article introduces a method that measures resemblance between sequences using a simple metric based on the insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to transform one sequence into another. The method, called optimal matching, is widely used in natural science. The article reviews the literature on sequence analysis, then discusses the optimal matching algorithm in some detail. Applying this technique to a data set detailing careers of musicians active in Germany in the 18th century demonstrates the practical steps involved in the application of the technique and develops a set of typical careers that successfully categorize most of the actual careers studied by the authors.},

Such regime changes are often followed by redistribution to the  poor at the expense of the former elite. We argue that the reason why the elite may have to resort to full-scale democratization, despite its apparent costs to themselves, may be that lesser concessions would be viewed as a sign a weakness and spur further unrest and more radical demands. The elite may therefore be forced to choose between repression and the most generous concession, a transition to full democracy.},

@article{Acemoglu.2008,
 abstract = {We study the formation of a ruling coalition in non-democratic societies where institutions do not enable political commitments. Each individual is endowed with a level of political power. The rulingcoalition consists of a subset of the individuals in the society and decides the distribution of resources. A ruling coalition needs to contain enough powerful members to win against any alternative coalition that may challenge it, and it needs to be self-enforcing, in the sense that none of its subcoalitions should be able to secede and become the new ruling coalition. We present both an axiomatic approach that captures these notions and determines a (generically) unique ruling coalition and the analysis of a dynamic game of coalition formation that encompasses these ideas. We establish that the subgame-perfect equilibria of the coalition formation game coincide with the set of ruling coalitions resulting from the axiomatic approach. A key insight of our analysis is that a coalition is made self-enforcing by the failure of its winning subcoalitions to be self-enforcing. This is most simply illustrated by the following example: with ``majority rule'', two-person coalitions are generically not self-enforcing and consequently, three-person coalitions are self-enforcing (unless one player is disproportionately powerful). We also characterize the structure of ruling coalitions. For example, we determine the conditions under which ruling coalitions are robust to small changes in the distribution of power and when they are fragile.We also show that when the distribution of power across individuals is relatively equal and there is majoritarian voting, only certain sizes of coalitions (e.g. with majority rule, coalitions of size 1, 3, 7, 15, etc.) can be the ruling coalition.},

The elite may build a strong military and make the concessions necessary for the military to behave as their perfect agent, or they may risk the military turning against them. Once the transition to democracy takes place, a strong military poses a threat against the nascent democratic regime until it is reformed. We study the role of income inequality and natural resources in the emergence of military dictatorships and show how the national defense role of the military may facilitate democratic consolidation.},

 abstract = {How does the strength of a state's coercive apparatus under autocracy affect the likelihood of democratic transition? While a broad range of literature posits a negative link between repression and democracy, empirical models of the determinants of democratization rarely include measures that capture this relationship. An original panel dataset with a global scope from 1950-2002 enables an empirical assessment of whether coercive capacity is negatively associated with democracy. The dataset demonstrates that increased coercive capacity under autocracy has a strong, robust negative impact on both a country's level of democracy as well as the likelihood of democratization. The analysis suggests that empirical studies of democratization should include measures of repression to account for the widely assumed link between coercive capacity and autocracy.},

@article{Albrecht.2005,
 abstract = {While many observers of politics in the Arab world hold that the emergence of political opposition would be a harbinger of democratization, this article argues that opposition can contribute to the stability and resilience of authoritarian regimes. Based on an empirical analysis of contemporary Egyptian politics, it is shown that, despite the repressive nature of the Egyptian state, political opposition has emerged in various societal contexts: political parties, human rights associations and a popular Islamist current. In order to understand this development, it is important to investigate authoritarian survival strategies `beyond coercion'. While militant resistance from radical Islamists has been successfully oppressed during the 1990s, the Egyptian incumbents reacted to the challenge of societal dissent by co-opting opposition forces. As a consequence, political opposition in Egypt serves functions entirely different from those in liberal democracies. It contributes to the legitimacy of the Egyptian state. Moreover, by tolerating controlled opposition, societal dissent can be better observed, channelled and moderated. From a more general perspective, political dissent exists in various settings: it prevails not only among opposition, but also within the political elite leading to a delicate juggling act of competing ideas and interests performed at the helm of the polity.},

@article{Alexander.2008,
 abstract = {Despite the central place of democratization studies in comparative politics, scholars still lack both theory and empirical evidence to understand institutional change in hybrid regimes (characterized by a collapse of one authoritarian regime and failure to transition to a consolidated democracy). This article makes a contribution to the emerging study of hybrid regimes by developing a middle-range theory for a medium-N set of previously neglected cases in Southeast Europe. It theorizes institutional change as a process initiated by the elites in power but then either accelerated or hampered by structural factors. After decomposing the effects of state capacity, opposition, and international influence in this dynamic and focusing on the process rather than the outcome, it is possible to refine the standard assumptions of democratization paradigm. The study finds that a strong state, a united opposition, and Western assistance can help authoritarian-leaning governments consolidate their coercive power.},

 abstract = {Political conflict across Africa is often linked to the pervasive use of patronage in retaining control of the state. However, few sources of data have been available to systematically examine the relationship between a leader's patronage strategies and the likelihood of an extraconstitutional change in power. This article employs ministerial appointments to the cabinet as a proxy for changes in the size of a leader's patronage coalition. With timeseries cross-section data on 40 African countries, this study shows that the size of cabinets varies systematically according to regime type, resource constraints, ethnic fractionalization, and total population. It then shows that African leaders extend their tenure in office by expanding their patronage coalition through cabinet appointments. A proportional hazards model of regime duration indicates that cabinet expansion lowers the probability of a leader's being deposed through a coup. The appointment of one additional minister to the cabinet lowers a leader's coup risk by a greater extent than does a 1-percentage-point increase in economic growth.},

 abstract = {Seit Beginn des 21. Jahrhunderts erleben der Autoritarismus und mit ihm die Autoritarismusforschung eine Renaissance. Um die spezifischen Erkenntnisse und Grenzen dieser Forschungsrichtung herauszuarbeiten, analysiert die vorliegende Literaturschau gleicherma{\ss}en neuere Beitr{\"a}ge der Comparative Politics wie der Regionalforschung zum Nahen Osten. Die zus{\"a}tzliche Fokussierung auf die neuere Nahostforschung erlaubt es, Erkenntnisse aus derjenigen Region mit in den Blick zu nehmen, die durch das im globalen Vergleich h{\"o}chste Ma{\ss} autorit{\"a}rer Regimestabilit{\"a}t gekennzeichnet ist.

Insgesamt zeigt sich, dass die gegenw{\"a}rtige Autoritarismusforschung von institutionalistischen Ans{\"a}tzen mit deren Konzentration auf autorit{\"a}re Institutionen (Herrscher, Regimeparteien) sowie Mechanismen (Legitimierung, Kooptation, Manipulation der Opposition) dominiert wird. Was polit{\"o}konomische sowie internationale und regionale Erkl{\"a}rungsfaktoren autorit{\"a}rer Regimestabilit{\"a}t angeht, so sind es neuere Beitr{\"a}ge der Nahostforschung, die {\"u}ber den traditionellen Rentierstaats-Ansatz hinausweisen und allzu demokratisierungsfreundliche Annahmen westlicher Au{\ss}enpolitik gegen{\"u}ber autorit{\"a}ren Regimes in Frage stellen. Die Grenzen der neueren Autoritarismusforschung bestehen insbesondere im ungekl{\"a}rten Verst{\"a}ndnis politischer Stabilit{\"a}t, in ihrer einseitigen Regimefokussierung und der damit verbundenen Staatsvergessenheit.},

improvements in the standard of living predict increases in democracy,

as measured by a subjective indicator of electoral rights. The

propensity for democracy rises with per capita GDP, primary

schooling, and a smaller gap between male and female primary

attainment. For a given standard of living, democracy tends to fall

with urbanization and with a greater reliance on natural resources.

Democracy has little relation to country size but rises with the

middle-class share of income. The apparently strong relation of

democracy to colonial heritage mostly disappears when the economic

variables are held constant. Similarly, the allowance for

these economic variables weakens the interplay between democracy

and religious affiliation. However, negative effects from Muslim

and non-religious affiliations remain intact.},

 abstract = {International efforts to promote democracy can have unanticipated effects. International election observation is perceived to increase domestic confidence in the electoral process and reduce fraud. Conversely, election boycotts are perceived to be more likely as electoral fairness decreases. The authors document a puzzling relationship between monitored elections and opposition party boycotts: Observers are associated with an increased boycott probability. They argue that international benefits for democratic elections give electoral autocrats the incentive to invite international observers and manipulate elections to minimize international criticism. This increase in ``strategic manipulation'' has led to changed incentives for opposition political parties, which have the most to lose from a manipulated but internationally certified election. Consequently, international monitors increase boycott probability. The authors support this explanation with an original data set of elections, boycotts, and international observers (1990 to 2002).},

 abstract = {Rational choice, historical institutionalism and sociological institutionalism are under criticism from a new `constructivist institutionalism' -- with critics claiming that established positions cannot explain institutional change effectively, because agents are highly constrained by their institutional environments. These alleged problems in explaining institutional change are exaggerated and can be dealt with by using a suitably tailored historical institutionalism. This places active, interpretive agents at the centre of analysis, in institutional settings modelled as more flexible than those found in `sticky' versions of historical institutionalism. This alternative approach also absorbs core elements of constructivism in explaining institutional change. The article concludes with empirical illustrations, mainly from Australian politics, of the key claims about how agents operate within institutions with `bounded discretion', and how institutional environments can shape and even empower agency in change processes.},

However, the internal variation in regime collapse and survival observed in the region confirms earlier analyses that the comportment of the coercive apparatus, especially its varying will to repress, is pivotal to determining the durability of the authoritarian regimes. At the same time, the trajectory of the Arab Spring highlights an empirical novelty for the Arab world, namely, the manifestation ofhuge, cross-class, popular protest in the name of political change, as well as a new factor that abetted the materialization of this phenomenon---the spread of social media. The latter will no doubt be a game changer for the longevity of authoritarian regimes worldwide from now on.},

 abstract = {For generations, influential thinkers--often citing the tragic polarization that took place during Germany's Great Depression--have suspected that people's loyalty to democratic institutions erodes under pressure and that citizens gravitate toward antidemocratic extremes in times of political and economic crisis. But do people really defect from democracy when times get tough? Do ordinary people play a leading role in the collapse of popular government?

Based on extensive research, this book overturns the common wisdom. It shows that the German experience was exceptional, that people's affinity for particular political positions are surprisingly stable, and that what is often labeled polarization is the result not of vote switching but of such factors as expansion of the franchise, elite defections, and the mobilization of new voters. Democratic collapses are caused less by changes in popular preferences than by the actions of political elites who polarize themselves and mistake the actions of a few for the preferences of the many. These conclusions are drawn from the study of twenty cases, including every democracy that collapsed in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution in interwar Europe, every South American democracy that fell to the Right after the Cuban Revolution, and three democracies that avoided breakdown despite serious economic and political challenges.

Unique in its historical and regional scope, this book offers unsettling but important lessons about civil society and regime change--and about the paths to democratic consolidation today.},

 abstract = {Using an original dataset that covers the period from 1951 to 1995, we

consider the enduring effects of Western overseas colonialism on the

democratic survival of postcolonial democracies. We treat colonialism as

a holistic phenomenon and differentiate the relative effects of its legacies

with regard to the level of economic development, social fragmentation,

and the relationship between the state and civil society. We find that

Western overseas colonialism, a factor often overlooked in recent large-n

studies, continues to have an effect on the survival of democratic

regimes. We further find that the legacy of specific colonial powers has

an important effect on survival as well. Unlike previous studies, we find

that former Spanish colonies outperform British colonies when

colonialism is conceptualized holistically. However, when we break

colonial legacy into separate components (development, social fragmentation, and the relationship between the state and civil society), we

find that the advantages former British colonies enjoy are attributable to

the legacy of the state/civil society relationship. Moreover, we show that

at least in the case of former British colonies, time spent under colonial

rule is positively associated with democratic survival.},

It is exactly this constitutional trait of totalitarianism which is one of the main differences distinguishing it from dictatorship or tyranny, since the latter are characterized by the uncontrolled discretionary power of the tyrant. Finally, necessary elements of the Constitution of Totalitarianism are identified.

 abstract = {Dramatic world change has stimulated interest in research questions about the dynamics of politics. We have seen increases in the number of time series data sets and the length of typical time series. But three shortcomings ate prevalent in published time series analysis. First, analysts often estimate models without testing restrictions implied by their specification. Second, researchers link the theoretical concept of equilibrium with cointegration and error correction models. Third, analysts often do a poor job of interpreting results. The consequences include weak connections between theory and tests, biased estimates, and incorrect inferences. We outline techniques for estimating linear dynamic regressions with stationary data and weakly exogenous regressors. We recommend analysts (1) start with general dynamic models and test restrictions before adopting a particular specification and (2) use the wide array of information available from dynamic specifications. We illustrate this strategy with data on Congressional approval and tax rates across OECD countries.},

The recent proliferation of hybrid regimes has encouraged attempts to empirically capture these new categories with the help of existing measures of democracy, raising the question of how one can go from degree to type. This issue has gained in salience because of the claim that incomplete democratic transitions, stopping halfway between dictatorship and democracy, increase the chance of war. This article presents a first overview of the different ways in which democratization has been defined and measured. In addition, it shows how scholars have used Freedom House and Polity scores to build regime typologies. A reexamination of the results of Mansfield and Snyder's thesis about democratization and war shows the importance of operationalization and casts further doubt on the empirical robustness of their claims.},

Initial work employed dichotomous indicators and incorporated stability into political democracy measures. Evidence accumulated showing that this approach could adversely affect analyses, particularly in the study of income inequality. Despite this, some recent studies have renewed the flawed practices. We draw upon recent work to highlight the confusion that can result when democracy and stability are confounded and the problems with dichotomous indicators. We propose that stability is analytically distinct from political democracy and should be treated as such empirically, and we suggest ways to estimate incremental effects of political democracy. We further argue that political democracy is continuous and that measures of it should reflect this. It is important that the measurement history of this construct not repeat itself.},

 abstract = {In the post--cold war period, civil wars are increasingly likely to end with peace settlements brokered by international actors who press for early elections. However, elections held soon after wars end, when political institutions remain weak, are associated with an increased likelihood of a return to violence. International actors have a double-edged influence over election timing and the risk of war, often promoting precarious military stalemates and early elections but sometimes also working to prevent a return to war through peacekeeping, institution building, and powersharing. In this article, we develop and test quantitatively a model of the causes of early elections as a building block in evaluating the larger effect of election timing on the return to war.},

This article assesses the causal effects of hybrid regimes, and the post--cold war period itself, on regime breakdown and democratization. Using a dataset of 158 regimes from 1975 to 2004, and a discrete measure for transitions to electoral democracy, I find that competitive authoritarian regimes are not especially prone to losing power but are significantly more likely to be followed by electoral democracy: vigorous electoral contestation does not independently subvert authoritarianism, yet it bodes well for democratic prospects once incumbents are overthrown.},

 abstract = {What explains electoral stability and change in competitive authoritarian regimes? This article addresses the question by comparing eleven elections---six of which led to continuity in authoritarian rule and five of which led to the victory of the opposition---that took place between 1998 and 2008 in competitive authoritarian regimes countries located in the postcommunist region. Using interviews conducted with participants in all of these elections and other types of data and constructing a research design that allowed the authors to match these two sets of elections on a number of important dimensions, they assess two groups of hypotheses---those that highlight institutional, structural, and historical aspects of regime and opposition strength on the eve of these elections and others that highlight characteristics of the elections themselves. The authors conclude that the key difference was whether the opposition adopted a tool kit of novel and sophisticated electoral strategies that made them more popular and effective challengers to the regime.},

Valerie J. Bunce and Sharon L. Wolchik compare these unexpected electoral breakthroughs with one another and with elections that had the more typical result of maintaining authoritarian rule. They draw three conclusions. First, the opposition was victorious because of the hard and creative work of a transnational network composed of local opposition and civil society groups, members of the international democracy assistance community, and graduates of successful electoral challenges to authoritarian rule in other countries. Second, the remarkable run of these upset elections reflected the ability of this network to diffuse an ensemble of innovative electoral strategies across state boundaries. Finally, elections can serve as a powerful mechanism for democratic change. This is especially the case when civil society is strong, the transfer of political power is through constitutional means, and opposition leaders win with small mandates{\dq}--.},

The analysis of successful reactions to strong extremist challenges in three cases of democratic survival (Czechoslovakia, Finland and Belgium in the inter-war period) against the background of two cases of breakdown in the same historical context (Italy and theWeimar Republic) is a useful complement to this view. The analysis of the selected cases shows how a stable coalition of democratic forces can effectively protect the democratic system from dangerous extremist attacks by pursuing both repressive and inclusive strategies.},

 abstract = {This article lays the theoretical and methodological foundations of a new historically minded approach to the comparative study of democratization, centered on the analysis of the creation, development, and interaction of democratic institutions. Historically, democracy did not emerge as a singular coherent whole but rather as a set of different institutions, which resulted from conflicts across multiple lines of social and political cleavage that took place at different moments in time. The theoretical advantage of this approach is illustrated by highlighting the range of new variables that come into focus in explaining democracy's emergence. Rather than class being the single variable that explains how and why democracy came about, scholars can see how religious conflict, ethnic cleavages, and the diffusion of ideas played a much greater role in Europe's democratization than has typically been appreciated. Above all, the authors argue that political parties were decisive players in how and why democracy emerged in Europe and should be at the center of future analyses.},

Comp. Int. Dev. 31(2):3--36, 1996). This extension focuses on how incumbents are removed from office. We argue that differences across regime measures must be taken seriously and that they should be evaluated in terms of whether they (1) serve to address important research questions, (2) can be interpreted meaningfully, and (3) are reproducible. We argue that existing measures of democracy are not interchangeable and that the choice of measure should be guided by its theoretical and empirical underpinnings. We show that the choice of regime measure matters by replicating studies published in leading journals.},

This exercise results in a number of clear prescriptions for the analysis of politics and institutional change: disaggregate institutions into schemas and resources; decompose institutional durability into processes of reproduction, disruption, and response to disruption; and, above all, appreciate the multiplicity and heterogeneity of the institutions that make up the social world. Recent empirical work on identities, interests, alternatives, and political innovation illustrates how political scientists and sociologists have begun to document the consequences of institutional contradiction and multiplicity and to trace the workings of institutional containment, diffusion, and mediation.},

Giovanni Sartori's work on conceptual{\dq} traveling{\dq} and conceptual{\dq} stretching{\dq} provides helpful guidance in addressing this fundamental task of comparative analysis.Yet Sartori's framework draws upon what may be called classical  categorization, which  views the relation among categories in terms of a taxonomic hierarchy, with each category having clear boundaries and defining properties shared by all members. We examine the challenge to this framework presented by two types of nonclassical categories: family resemblances and radial categories. With such categories, the overly strict application of a classical framework can lead to abandoning to category prematurely or to modifying it inappropriately. We discuss solutions to these problems, using examples of how scholars have adapted their categories in comparativere search on democracy and authoritarianism.},

 abstract = {Prominent scholars engaged in comparative research on democratic regimes are in sharp disagreement over the choice between a dichotomous or graded approach to the distinction between democracy and nondemocracy. This choice is substantively important because it affects the findings of empirical research. It is methodologically important because it raises basic issues, faced by both qualitative and quantitative analysts, concerning appropriate standards for justifying choices about concepts. In our view, generic claims that the concept of democracy should inherently be treated as dichotomous or graded are incomplete. The burden of demonstration should instead rest on more specific arguments linked to the goals of research. We thus take the pragmatic position that how scholars understand and operationalize a concept can and should depend in part on what they are going to do with it. We consider justifications focused on the conceptualization of democratization as an event, the conceptual requirements for analyzing subtypes of democracy, the empirical distribution of cases, normative evaluation, the idea of regimes as bounded wholes, and the goal of achieving sharper analytic differentiation.},

 abstract = {Leaders can select from a myriad of repressive techniques to quell their domestic po- litical opposition. In this project, we investigate (1) why states differ in their choice of repressive tactics, and (2) how individual states combine and trade-off between repressive tactics. In the absence of existing work on repressive policy complementarity and substitutability, we turn to the political science literature on foreign policy substitutability and the economics literature on complementarity and substitutability. By focusing on the expected costs and benefits of repression in general and of imprisonment, torture, and state-sponsored killing in particular, we develop a theory about the conditions under which state leaders choose packages of repressive techniques and/or substitute one repressive policy for another. We argue that leaders respond to the increasing costliness of type of repression by limiting the use of that tactic and ramping up other violations (i.e., through substitution), or by adding additional tactics into the mix to minimize tactic-specific costs (i.e., through complementarity).},

The scale measures the degree to which national political systems meet the minimum requirements for political democracy, where real-world{\dq} democracies{\dq} rather than abstract ideals are the standard. The Polyarchy Scale is constructed from indicators of freedom of expression, freedom of organization, media pluralism, and the holding of fair elections. The scale is (1) well grounded in democratic theory, (2) world-wide in scope, (3) demonstrably valid, (4) solves problems of weighting indicators, and (5) is easy to interpret and replicate.

Over the past 40 years, the systematic study of state repression has grown considerably. The development of thiswork, however, has been uneven. Though unified in their focus on the problem of order (i.e., trying to ascertain how political authorities wield coercive power amid potential and actual domestic challengers), different scholars tend to emphasize distinct aspects of the topic. Consequently, a great deal of progress has been made in specific areas but others have lagged behind. In this review, I attempt to identify the dominant traditions in the repression literature, the core empirical findings, and some persisting puzzles.},

 abstract = {Existing literature on state repression generally ignores the diversity that exists within autocracies. At present, different political systems are collapsed together, leaving unique approaches to political order unexamined. This limitation is important for poliymakers, activists, and everyday citizens around the world seeking new ways to reduce government coercion. Within this study, the author explores an alternative path to decreasing repression - a 'tyrannical peace'. Examining 137 countries from 1976 to 1996, he finds that single-party regimes are generally less repressive than other autocracies. Results also show that military governments decrease civil liberties restriction and the end of the Cold War has varied influences on repression, depending upon the form considered and whether this variable is interacted with another. There are thus alternative routes to peace, but these routes are not equally robust. The implications of this analysis are threefold. First, those interested in understanding why states restrict civil liberties and violate human rights must disaggregate their conceptions of system type and repression. Second, policymakers must adjust their approach to reducing state repression according to the type of authoritarian government they are confronted with. Third, advocates for human rights must accept that, in lieu of full democratization, alternatives exist.},

 abstract = {{\dq}Does democracy decrease state repression in line with the expectations of governments, international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, social movements, scholars, and ordinary citizens around the world? At present, most believe that a domestic democratic peace exists, rivaling that found in the realm of interstate conflict. Based on an investigation of 137 countries from 1976 to 1996, this book seeks to shed light on this question. Specifically, three results emerge. First, even though different aspects of democracy decrease repressive behavior, not all do so to the same degree. Human rights violations are especially responsive to electoral participation and competition. Second, although different types of repression are reduced, not all are limited at comparable levels. Personal integrity violations are decreased more than civil liberties restrictions. Third, the domestic democratic peace is not bulletproof; the negative influence of democracy on repression can be overwhelmed by political conflict. This research alters our conception of repression, its analysis, and its resolution.{\dq}--BOOK JACKET.},

@article{Desai.2009,
 abstract = {Dictatorships do not survive by repression alone. Rather, dictatorial rule is often explained as an authoritarian bargain by which citizens relinquish political rights for economic security. The applicability of the authoritarian bargain to decision-making in non-democratic states, however, has not been thoroughly examined. We conceptualize this bargain as a simple game between a representative citizen and an autocrat who faces the threat of insurrection, and where economic transfers and political influence are simultaneously determined. Our model yields implications for empirical patterns that are expected to exist. Tests of a system of equations with panel data comprising 80 non-democratic states between 1975 and 1999 generally confirm the predictions of the authoritarian-bargain thesis, with some variation across different categories of dictatorship.},

This lecture argues that the answers to both questions are yes, and that neither culture nor history nor poverty are insurmountable obstacles. Indeed, for much of the world that remains trapped in poverty, a growing body of evidence and policy analysis suggests that democratic, accountable, transparent governance is a fundamental condition for sustainable development. There are no preconditions for democracy, other than a willingness on the part of a nation's elite to attempt to govern by democratic means. But that, in itself, will require strong pressure from below, in civil society, and from outside, in the international community, to generate the political will for democratic reform. And sustaining democracy in the context of unfavorable cultural, social, and economic conditions requires institutions to foster effective, accountable governance as well as robust international engagement and support. Democracy can emerge anywhere, but it can only take root if it brings about, however gradually, a more prosperous, just, and decent society.},

We then specify hypotheses about the impact of resource centralization and dependency, goal ambiguity and technical uncertainty, and professionalization and structuration on isomorphic change. Finally, we suggest implications for theories of organizations and social change.},

Empirically, the article examines three cases, Tanzania, Russia, and Venezuela, looking specifically at electoral participation and support for the opposition, as well as the potential for political change, i.e. public discontent and conditions for mobilization. The article demonstrates that the stability of hybrid regimes is related to the incumbents' ability to circumvent the opposition, but also to the lack of interplay between citizens and opposition parties.},

The higher the degree of institutionalization of the regime, the higher the perceived levels of legitimacy, efficiency and credibility, so taxes that require cooperation and compliance can be more effectively collected from the population. Institutionalized regimes thus make sense if non-tax revenue sources are scarce so limited representation must be granted in exchange of economic support. Our selection-corrected results show that more institutionalized regimes are able to collect more taxes on inclome, profits and capital gains, taxes on goods and services, taxes on property and payroll taxes.},

If sanctions are assumed to increase the price of loyalty to the regime, then rulers whose budgets are not severely constrained by sanctions will tend to increase spending in those categories that most benefit their core support groups. In contrast, when constraints are severe due to reduced aid and trade, dictators are expected to greatly increase their levels of repression. Using data on regime types, public expenditures and spending composition (1970--2000) as well as on repression levels (1976--2001), we show that the empirical patterns conform well to our theoretical expectations. Single-party regimes, when targeted by sanctions, increase spending on subsidies and transfers which largely benefit more substantial sectors of the population and especially the urban classes. Likewise, military regimes increase their expenditures on goods and services, which include military equipment and soldiers' and officers' wages. Conversely, personalist regimes reduce spending in all categories, especially capital expenditures, while increasing repression much more than other regime types when targeted by sanctions.},

New data on dictators' modes of exit for the period 1946--2000 allow us to estimate the predicted likelihood that a given authoritarian head of government will be toppled by the elite, the military or the citizenry. When the predicted odds are used as a measure of group strength, the results of simple growth regressions reveal that a stronger citizen opposition or a greater military threat compels the ruler to improve economic growth rates. In contrast, elite power is negative for growth, although it turns positive when a country reaches a certain level of industrialized development.},

Gsta Esping-Andersen, one of the foremost contributors to current debates on this issue, here provides a new analysis of the character and role of welfare states in the functioning of contemporary advanced Western societies. Esping-Andersen distinguishes three major types of welfare state, connecting these with variations in the historical development of different Western countries. He argues that current economic processes, such as those moving toward a postindustrial order, are shaped not by autonomous market forces but by the nature of states and state differences. Fully informed by comparative materials, this book will have great appeal to all those working on issues of economic development and postindustrialism. Its audience will include students of sociology, economics, and politics.},

 abstract = {{\dq}The majority of data sets collected by researchers in all disciplines are multivariate, meaning that several measurements, observations, or recordings are taken on each of the units in the data set. These units might be human subjects, archaeological artifacts, countries, or a vast variety of other things. In a few cases, it may be sensible to isolate each variable and study it separately, but in most instances all the variables need to be examined simultaneously in order to fully grasp the structure and key features of the data. For this purpose, one or another method of multivariate analysis might be helpful, and it is with such methods that this book is largely concerned. Multivariate analysis includes methods both for describing and exploring such data and for making formal inferences about them. The aim of all the techniques is, in general sense, to display or extract the signal in the data in the presence of noise and to find out what the data show us in the midst of their apparent chaos. An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R explores the correct application of these methods so as to extract as much information as possible from the data at hand, particularly as some type of graphical representation, via the R software. Throughout the book, the authors give many examples of R code used to apply the multivariate techniques to multivariate data.{\dq}--Publisher's description.},

 abstract = {Political scientists largely agree that causal mechanisms are crucial to understanding causation. Recent advances in qualitative and quantitative methodology suggest that causal explanations must be contextually bounded. Yet the relationship between context and mechanisms and this relationship's importance for causation are not well understood. This study defines causal mechanisms as portable concepts that explain how and why a hypothesized cause, in a given context, contributes to a particular outcome. In turn, it defines context as the relevant aspects of a setting in which an array of initial conditions leads to an outcome of a defined scope and meaning via causal mechanisms.

The theory shows that the primary determinants affecting the timing of democratic transitions are per capita income, the distribution of wealth, educational levels, and the strength of preferences for political rights and civil liberties. The implications of the theory are tested by estimating a proportional hazard function to determine the probability of a democratic transition at a particular point in time. The empirics demonstrate strong support for the model in an estimation of 75 countries during the postwar period.},

@article{Filippov.1999,
 abstract = {Despite its controversial status as a stable governmental form, many of today's societies attempting to make the transition to democracy have or will, for a variety of reasons, choose presidentialism. Meanwhile, the evidence suggests that the combination of presidentialism and multipartism is especially dangerous for democratic stability (Mainwaring 1994). The question this essay addresses, though, is whether presidential elections themselves serve to encourage a fragmented party system, at least in the initial stages of democratization. In transitional political systems presidential elections encourage party fragmentation, but in a way different from that of highly proportional purely parliamentary mechanisms. Specifically, parties proliferate to support the presidential aspirations of political elites. Multivariate regression analysis on cross-sectional aggregate electoral data, supported by extensive outliers diagnostics and assessments of the role of country-specific effects is applied. A nested model is used to discriminate among the secondary hypotheses. Controls include: parliamentary election rules (district magnitude, threshold for representation, adjustment districts, ballot structure), relative timing of presidential and parliamentary elections, and basic societal cleavage structure. Using as our data source the recent elections in East and Central Europe and the European part of the former Soviet Union, we show that presidential elections consistently significantly increase party fragmentation. At the same time, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that presidentialism does encourage the overall consolidation in party systems through voters' abandonment of some parties, akin to Duverger's 'psychological effect'.},

I develop a conceptual view of the social institutions that comprise markets, discuss a sociological model of action in which market participants try to create stable worlds andfind social solutions to competition, and discuss how markets and states are intimately linked. From these foundations, I generate propositions about how politics in markets work during various stages of market development-formation, stability, and transformation. At the formation of markets, when actors in firms are trying to create a status hierarchy that enforces noncompetitive forms of competition, political action resembles social movements. In stable markets, incumbent firms defend their positions against challengers and invaders. During periods of market transformation, invaders can reintroduce more fluid socialmovement-like conditions.},

I present a critique of these theories that focuses on their inadequate attention to the role of social power and actors in the creation of institutions. An alternative view of the dynamics of institutions is sketched out based on a more sociological conception of rules, resources, and social skill.},

In addition, these institutions frequently serve to divide the opposition since those groups who are allowed to participate become privileged insiders while other groups remain excluded from the political realm. Yet sometimes these institutions cease to serve the intentions of their creators and become the source of challenges to dictatorial regimes by helping opposition groups coordinate to mount challenges to the existing authoritarian order. Under what conditions, then, do presidential elections under dictatorship lead opposition parties and candidates to coordinate their efforts to defeat authoritarian incumbents? In this paper, I argue that coordination among opposition candidates is less likely when the likelihood of a regime change and the constitutionallystipulated powers of the presidency are high. Under these conditions, no candidate can induce others to withdraw from the race because promises to share power after election are not credible when the office of the presidency confers significant power. A quantitative analysis of all presidential elections in non-democratic states from 1946 to 2002 provides some evidence for these claims. The results demonstrate how constitutional rules, while doing little to constrain the behavior of incumbents in dictatorial regimes, play a role in conditioning the future expectations and behavior of opposition parties and candidates.},

The authors argue that when authoritarian rulers need to solicit the cooperation of outsiders or deter the threat of rebellion, they rely on political institutions.

By broadening the basis of support for autocrats, these institutions lengthen their tenures.

These tendencies have kept scholars from asking a wide range of questions about the micro-level dynamics of authoritarian elections and the systematic differences among them.With these issues in mind, this review examines literature that investigates the purpose of elections in dictatorships; the electoral behavior of voters, candidates, and incumbents in these elections; and the link between elections and democratization. The review ends with a call to redirect the study of authoritarian elections toward uncovering and explaining the important differences among them.},

@misc{Gandhi.2010,
 abstract = {Under what conditions do opposition parties form pre-electoral coalitions in authoritarian elections? When opposition parties form coalitions for presidential elections, they are agreeing to a distribution of offices whereby in the case of victory, one of them becomes president while the others receive cabinet portfolios. Yet the nature of the contract creates a commitment problem when the potential winner stands to inherit a strong presidency: no party can be sure that a strong president will not renege on the agreement and create future advantages for his side. Parties' expectations about what type of presidency they may inherit, in turn, are influenced by constitutional rules regarding presidential power. The 2008 presidential elections in Zimbabwe illustrate these claims while a quantitative analysis of all presidential elections in non-democratic states from 1946 to 2002 provides a test of them. The evidence shows that the constitutional rules governing presidential power, while doing little to constrain the behavior of incumbents in dictatorial regimes, play a role in conditioning the future expectations and behavior of opposition parties and candidates.},

The main goal of the project is to assemble and analyze a large cross-national dataset containing indicators of the three basic political regime types (democracy, totalitarianism, and authoritarianism) and a variety of politcal regime subtypes (e.g., parliamentary democracy, bureaucratic authoritarianism). This dataset will contain yearly measures of political regime type and subtype for 117 major countries from 1946 (or a country's first full year of independence) through 1988. The author plans to use this dataset as the basis for a comprehensive study of the determinants and performance of political regimes, and will eventually make the dataset available to other researchers. The comprehensive scope of the Political Regimes Database, its time series properties, and the elaborate typology of regimes that it is based upon will enable researchers to examine political regimes in novel ways that may yield valuable new insights.},

Using a statistical f technique known as event history analysis and a new data set that identifies all instances of regime 5 change in the 97 largest Third World countries, I develop multivariate models of democratic breakdown and democratic transition. My main findings are that inflationary crises inhibited democratizationfr om the 1950s through the early 1970s but may have facilitated it in the late 1980s and that recessionary crises facilitated democratic breakdown but had no effect on democratic transition throughout this period. The inflation findings-though not the recession findings-support the arguments of Karen Remmer and Samuel Huntington that the processes affecting democratization were very different in the 1980s than in earlier eras. A number of other explanatory variables emerge as significant determinants of regime change, providing support for several other contentions that have appeared in the literature.},

 abstract = {This essay synthesizes the results of the large number of studies of late.20thcentury democratization published during the last 20 years. Strong evidence supports the claims that democracy is more likely in more developed countries and that regime transitions of all kinds are more likely during economic downturns. Very few of the other arguments advanced in the transitions literature, however, appear to be generally true. This study proposes a theoretical model, rooted in characteristics of different types of authoritarian regimes, to explain many of the differences in democratization experience across cases in different regions. Evidence drawn from a data set that includes 163 authoritarian regimes offers preliminary support for the model proposed.},

@misc{Geddes.September1999,
 abstract = {This paper continues a project on the links between different authoritarian institutional structures and the likelihood and mode of transition to democracy. In earlier work, I have argued that different types of authoritarian government have different effects on the incentives confronting regime supporters when faced with challenges to the status quo. To summarize that argument, military regimes tend to split when challenged, personalist regimes to circle the wagons, and single-party regimes to coopt their challengers. This argument implies that military regimes are more likely to negotiate their own withdrawal and to democratize; personalist regimes rarely leave office voluntarily and more often end in popular uprising, revolution, invasion, or assassination; and single-party regimes tend to survive longer than the other two forms of authoritarianism, even in the face of severe economic crisis. I test these hypotheses using a new data set that includes information on nearly all the authoritarian regimes that have existed since 1946. To summarize the findings, military regimes, on average, survive less long than other types. They are more likely to negotiate their extrications and to be followed by competitive political systems. They are less likely to end in coups, popular uprising, armed insurgency, revolution, invasion, or assassination. Personalist regimes, in contrast, are more likely than other types to end in violence and upheaval. Their ends are also more likely to be precipitated by the death of the dictator or foreign pressure, and they are more likely to be followed by some new form of authoritarianism. Single-party regimes last the longest, but when uncontrollable popular opposition signals that the end is near, like the military, they negotiate the transition.},

 abstract = {A raft of new research on the causes and effects of political corruption has emerged in recent years, in tandem with a separate, growing focus on the effects of political institutions on important outcomes such as economic growth, social equality and political stability. Yet we know little about the possible role of different political institutional arrangements on political corruption. This article examines the impact of territorial sovereignty (unitary or federal) and the composition of the executive (parliamentary or presidential) on levels of perceived political corruption cross-nationally. We find that unitary and parliamentary forms of government help reduce levels of corruption. To explain this result, we explore a series of seven potential causal mechanisms that emerge out of the competing centralist and decentralist theoretical paradigms: (1) openness, transparency and information costs, (2) intergovernmental competition, (3) localism, (4) party competition, (5) decision rules, (6) collective action problems, and (7) public administration. Our empirical findings and our analysis of causal mechanisms suggest that centralized constitutions help foster lower levels of political corruption.},

 abstract = {In recent years, the importance of mechanism-centered explanation has become an article of faith within the social sciences, uniting researchers from a wide variety of methodological traditions -- quantitative and qualitative, experimental and nonexperimental, nomothetic and idiographic, formal models and narrative prose. Despite its many virtues, there are reasons to be skeptical of social science's newfound infatuation with causal mechanisms. First, the concept of a mechanism-centered (``mechanismic'') explanation is fundamentally ambiguous, meaning different things to different people. Second, the minimal objectives associated with the turn to mechanisms -- to specify causal mechanisms and engage in detailed causal reasoning -- are not at variance with traditional practices in the social sciences, and thus hardly qualify as a distinct approach to causal assessment. Finally, the more demanding goal of rigorously testing causal mechanisms in causal arguments is admirable but often unrealistic. To clarify, this is not a polemic against mechanisms. It is a polemic against a dogmatic interpretation of the mechanismic mission. Causal mechanisms are rightly regarded as an important, but secondary, element of causal assessment -- by no means a necessary condition.},

On the one hand, it proposes a conjunctural theory for the stability (and change) of autocratic regimes that is based on three interdependent pillars: legitimation, repression and co-optation. It is argued that these three pillars provide an autocracy with vital functions to maintain stability over time. In the course of the paper, emphasis is put on concept-building. On the other hand, the paper tries to make sense of the heterogeneous picture East Asia presents. While there are as many autocracies that have initiated democratization processes as autocracies that have remained stable in this region, the paper tries to find explanations for this phenomenon by making methodically use of fuzzy set QCA. Against the backdrop of the three pillar theory, first preliminary empirical results will be shown. The paper identifies different stabilizing paths which suggest an empirically based, typological distinction of stable autocracies that follow either an over- or a de-politicizing path. It is argued that these autocratic regimes are not just different in degree, but different in kind.},

 abstract = {In October 2007 Japan extended its unilateral sanctions against North Korea. Owing to this decision, the focus shifted from recent positive signals in dealing with the denuclearization to last year's North Korean nuclear test and the following attempts to sanction the regime. Against this background, the analysis first provides a short overview of the latest research on sanctions and then analyzes the increasing external pressure on North Korea since Pyongyang's missile and nuclear tests in 2006. Sanctions had been imposed by the USA, Japan and, for the first time, in its history also by the UN. Whereas the Japanese sanctions failed to harm North Korea's elite due to its comprehensive approach, the more targeted and multilateral sanctions of the UN could have been more effective. Yet, these sanctions were undermined by the diverging national interests of South Korea and China. Their respective rationale aim at stabilizing North Korea rather than taking destabilising measures. From a theoretical point of view, sanctioning North Korea could make sense as targeted (financial) sanctions against the elite could drive a wedge between Pyongyang's hard- and soft-liners and thus weaken intraelite cohesiveness as well as reduce essential financial patronage resources.},

 abstract = {The ongoing debate about appropriate regime typology resembles trench warfare. Since the demise of the concept of totalitarianism, by and large there is agreement on the two polar types: liberal democracy and some form of ``closed'' authoritarianism. Approaches of how to organize the space in between, however, are largely irreconcilable. The classical dichotomous understanding of democracy and autocracy as mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive entities is challenged by vows for more fine grained gradation that either introduces intermediate categories - hybrid regimes - or follows the idea of a regime continuum. In this paper, the two perspectives of a dichotomous versus a gradual approach are confronted. Do autocracies and democracies follow an inherent logic that -- as Sartori famously put it -- turns them into contradictions that exclude a third? Is the inclusion of hybrid regimes a conceptual step backwards leading to a loss of analytical rigor? Or, in contrast, does the separation of the political map of the world in two camps -- and two camps only -- fail to do justice to complex political realities? Do we not miss out on the fine but crucial dynamics of the grey zone if we insist the world is black and white? We first elaborate on the general logic of typology building. We then critically review strategies of concept formation and typology construction on both sides of the trench. Following Collier's and Adcock's (1999) magisterial article on the topic, we go on to discuss the usefulness and effects of dichotomy and trichotomy. Before we show that choice of concepts seriously affects the results of comparative study, we lay out what we call the `Sartorian dilemma': the irreconcilability of his idea of bounded wholes, contradictory relationships between autocracy and democracy as well his general advice of joint exhaustiveness and mutual exclusivity.},

I use a mainstream and ``thick'' definition of regime type, and posit that the least democratic subnational units in Argentina and other third-wave federations are better understood as hybrid regimes rather authoritarianisms.'' I discuss the implications of conceptualization for measurement, develop a than ``subnational this full operationalization of the concept, and present the methodological design of a survey of experts that serves as the measurement instrument. Preliminary results are presented as an illustration of the type of information that will be available once the survey is complete. Some dimensions of democracy --such as inclusion and fair counting of the votes-- show little interprovincial variance, while others --such as freedom of expression and institutional constraints on the executive-- vary considerably from province to province.},

In a research field dominated by empirical studies e such as the one on voter turnout e an overview of where we stand and what we know is not superfluous. Therefore, the present paper reviews and assesses the empirical evidence brought forward through a meta-analysis of 83 aggregate-level studies. We thereby concentrate on the effect of socio-economic, political and institutional variables. The results argue for the introduction of a `core' model of voter turnout e including, among other elements, population size and election closeness e that can be used as a starting point for extending our knowledge on why people vote.},

Using a dataset of judicial constraints across 163 different countries from 1960 to 2000, we find that established independent judiciaries prevent regime changes toward authoritarianism across all types of states. Established courts are also capable of thwarting regime collapses in nondemocracies. These results provide some of the first large-n evidence confirming the ability of the judiciary to maintain regime stability. Unfortunately, however, the beneficial effects of court systems seem to take time to develop. The evidence indicates that newly formed courts are positively associatedwith regime collapses in both democracies and nondemocracies.},

 abstract = {This paper appraises the state of the field on hybrid regimes by depicting the tensions and blurred boundaries of democracy and authoritarianism ``with adjectives.'' An alternative conceptualization and ordering of regimes are subsequently introduced using a configurative approach. Rather than place regimes on a linear continuum from authoritarianism to democracy, it highlights the multi-dimensional arrangements possible for the construction of regime types. The configurative approach also provides an analytically useful way to measure and integrate hybrid regimes into our classificatory schemes. As a result, it helps alleviate the conceptual confusion in the literature and contributes to a discussion of hybrid regimes beyond the framework of authoritarianism. The paper concludes by presenting a list of all hybrid regimes in the world between 1990 and 2009 identified with this method.},

For three decades, the Correlates of War project has served as the main supplier of reliable data used in longitudinal studies of external and internal armed conflict. The COW datasets on war use the relatively high threshold of 1,000 battle-deaths. The Uppsala dataset on armed conflict has a lower threshold, 25 annual battle-deaths, but has so far been available for only the post-Cold War period. This dataset has now been backdated to the end of World War II. This article presents a report on armed conflict based on this backdate as well as another annual update. It presents the procedures for the backdating, as well as trends over time and breakdowns for the type of conflict. It assesses the criteria for measuring armed conflict and discusses some directions for future data collection in this area.},

 abstract = {Two-level theories explain outcomes with causal variables at two levels of analysis that are systematically related to one another. Although many prominent scholars in the field of comparative analysis have developed two-level theories, the empirical and methodological issues that these theories raise have yet to be investigated. In this article, we explore different structures of two-level theories and consider the issues involved in testing these theories with fuzzy-set methods. We show that grasping the overall structure of two-level theories requires both specifying the particular type of relationship (i.e., causal, ontological, or substitutable) that exists between and within levels of analysis and specifying the logical linkages between levels in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. We argue that for the purposes of testing these theories fuzzy-set analysis provides a powerful set of tools. However, to realize this potential, investigators using fuzzy-set methods must be clear about the two-level structure of their theories from the onset. We illustrate these points through an empirical, fuzzy-set test of Skocpol's States and Social Revolutions.},

This article argues that a two-dimensional extension ofRiker's anticoordination thesis conflicts with Downsian extensions. It shows that when voters coordinate on a single challenger based on their shared preference on a cross-cutting cleavage, a vote-maximizing incumbent party should move away from the challenger on the primary dimension of compe tition, even at the risk of abandoning the center. The article develops this hypothesis with reference to dominant parties in competitive authoritarian regimes where challenger parties constantly attempt {\dq}heresthetical{\dq} moves by mobilizing regime issues into the partisan debate, and it tests the predictions with an original sample survey of national leaders of Mexico's Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI). It also spells out the implications of the findings for dominant party survivability in democratic transitions and, more broadly, for incumbents' spatial strategies in the face of new partisan cleavages.},

 abstract = {This paper asks (a) why and how institutions change, (b) how an institution persists in a changing environment, and (c) how processes that it unleashes lead to its own demise. The paper shows that the game-theoretic notion of self-enforcing equilibrium and the historical institutionalist focus on process are both inadequate to answer these questions. Building on a game-theoretic foundation, but responding to the critique of it by historical institutionalists, the paper introduces the concepts of quasi-parameters and self reinforcement. With these concepts, and building on repeated game theory, a dynamic approach to institutions is offered, one that can account for endogenous change (and stability) of institutions. Contextual accounts of formal governing institutions in early modern Europe and the informal institution of cleavage structure in the contemporary world provide illustrations of the approach.},

 abstract = {The international community of states has put much emphasis on institutionalizing stateinstitutions and democracy in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo for more than a decade now. However, both political interventions effected the consolidation of hybrid regimes with strong authoritarian elements on the ground, but not the consolidation of democracy. This paradox result of democracy promotion is in particular a problem for the European Union (EU). From the beginning the EU was urged to supervise in both countries a fragile peace process. This involvement bears a challenge: As a regional institution, foremost interested in well-developed economic relationships, the EU seeks the implementation of economic competition and political contestation. As a benevolent (and permanently interfering) supervisor of the peace process, foremost interested in regional security, the EU seeks stabilization of the political system and predictability of the target state's behaviour. As an unintended consequence, the EU thereby supports the development of two hybrid regimes with severe authoritarian deficits. That outcome can be explained by the fact that the EU is hardly able to perform two opposing roles at once that differ substantially in their goals and accordingly in their strategies to influence the preferences of the target elites. The two roles build on opposing logics of influencing domestic reform-making from the outside and thereby produce contradicting results.},

We show that although these indices are strongly correlated at the aggregate level, there are large differences among them at different levels of the democracy scale. Hence, it is of paramount importance to be able to make a well-founded choice among them. For this purpose we propose a general conceptual and methodological standard according to which the alternative indices should be evaluated. According to this standard, Polity and Freedom House outperforms its rivals. In an external assessment, we show that differences between these two leading indices cannot be explained in terms of region, religion or colonial background, but in part reflects the type of non-democratic regime. When compared against an independent yardstick in a sample of 37 country years with extremely large discrepancies between Polity and Freedom House, the former outperforms the latter, although the best fit appears when the two are averaged.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this article is to reassess two influential theories of democratic development: the theory of democratic culture and the theory of economic development. The leading predecessors in each domain---Ronald Inglehart and Adam Przeworski---are the prime targets of analysis. We take issue with recent evidence presented by these authors on three grounds: the evidence (1) confuses ``basic'' criteria of democracy with possible ``quality'' criteria (Inglehart); (2) conceptualizes democracy in dichotomous rather than continuous terms (Przeworski); and (3) fails to account for endogeneity and contingent effects (Inglehart). In correcting for these shortcomings, we present striking results. In the case of democratic culture, the theory lacks support; neither overt support for democracy nor ``self-expression values'' affect democratic development. In the case of economic development, earlier findings must be refined. Although the largest impact of modernization is found among more democratized countries, we also find an effect among ``semi-democracies.''},

To assess the usefulness of our typology, we explore the extent to which it helps explain the survival (and breakdown) of nondemocratic regimes. We also investigate the impact of different types of authoritarian regimes on democratic development. Our results demonstrate that different types of authoritarian regimes face different propensities to survive and to develop towards democracy. Hence an institutional attributethe nature of the authoritarian regime in questiondeserves to be added to the list of democracy's essential preconditions. In particular, one regime type---the limited multiparty system---stands out as the prime stepping-stone to democracy. The fact that this regime type has become the most common form of authoritarianism can be seen as a promising sign for the future.},

It is often assumed either that they set ``rules of the game,'' having effects by being followed, or that they do not matter, being overwhelmed by informal politics. In fact, a logic of collective action reveals that constitutions do matter, but as much by shaping informal political arrangements as by being obeyed. Presidentialist constitutions, through an information effect and a focal effect, generate expectations of future informal power that encourage clientelistic networks to coordinate law-disregarding practices around a ``single pyramid'' of power led by the president. The information and focal effects of divided-executive constitutions, by contrast, create expectations that complicate the coordination of clientelistic networks around a single patron, promoting ``competing-pyramid'' politics. To isolate the impact of formal constitutional design and rule out other causes, a tightly controlled process-tracing paired comparison is employed using Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan during 2005--10, explaining why Ukraine's Orange Revolution produced a true democratic opening (even if short lived) while Kyrgyzstan's Tulip Revolution did not.},

 abstract = {Contemporary approaches to varieties to capitalism are often criticized for neglecting issues of institutional change. This paper develops an approach to institutional change more extended than the one provided in Hall and Soskice (in Varieties of Capitalism: The Institutional Foundations of Comparative Advantage, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2001) but congruent with its varieties-ofcapitalism perspective. It begins by outlining an approach to institutional stability, which suggests that the persistence of institutions depends not only on their aggregate welfare effects but also on the distributive benefits that they provide to the underlying social or political coalitions; and not only on the Paretooptimal quality of such equilibria but also on continuous processes of mobilization through which the actors test the limits of the existing institutions. It then develops an analysis of institutional change that emphasizes the ways in which defection, reinterpretation and reform emerge out of such contestation and assesses the accuracy of this account against recent developments in the political economies of Europe. The paper concludes by outlining the implications of this perspective for contemporary analyses of liberalization in the political economy.},

It first provides an empirical assessment on the presence of MSP-Hamas elite in state institutions, which reveals that their co-optation is symbolic in terms of power sharing. This in turn brings about the question of what were the expectations of the actors involved in the co-optation process. While MSP-Hamas leaders expected to strengthen their party in order to take over power, it appears that they failed in their attempts to gain more influence in the decision-making process. Our analysis shows that it is the very conditions under which this elite was co-opted that precluded it to undermine authoritarian incumbents' hold on power.},

@book{Heydemann.1999,
 abstract = {{\dq}For almost forty years Syria has been ruled by a populist authoritarian regime under the Ba'th Party, led since 1970 by President Hafiz al-Asad. The durability and resilience of this regime is a striking contrast to the instability and intense social conflict that preceded the Ba'th's seizure of power, when Syria was seen as among the least stable of Arab states. This dramatic transition raises questions about how the Ba'th succeeded in constructing the institutions needed to consolidate a radically populist and authoritarian system of rule. [...] Drawing on evidence from Syrian, American, and British archives as well as from published French and Arabic sources, Steven Heydemann explains the capacity of the Ba'th to overcome the obstacles that typically undermine the consolidation of radical populist regimes. He links the Ba'th's adoption of a radical populist strategy of state building, and its capacity to implement this strategy, to the dynamics of social conflict, state expansion, and structural change in the political economy of post-independence Syria. Arguing that conventional accounts of Syrian politics neglect the centrality of institutions and institutional change, Heydemann shows how shifts in the pattern of state intervention after 1946 transformed Syria's poetical arena.{\dq}--BOOK JACKET.},

 abstract = {In the wake of the third wave of democratization, competitive authoritarianism has emerged as a prominent regime type. These regimes feature regular, competitive elections between a government and an opposition, but the incumbent leader or party typically resorts to coercion, intimidation, and fraud to attempt to ensure electoral victory. Despite the incumbent's reliance on unfair practices to stay in power, such elections occasionally result in what we call a ``liberalizing electoral outcome'' (LEO), which often leads to a new government that is considerably less authoritarian than its predecessor. Using a ``nested'' research design that employs both cross-national statistical analysis and a case study of Kenya, we seek to explain how and why LEOs occur. Our findings highlight in particular the importance of the choices made by opposition elites to form a strategic coalition for the purpose of mounting a credible challenge to the ruling party or candidate in national elections.},

 abstract = {The concept of {\dq}political stability{\dq} is an excellent illustration of the fuzziness and confusion existing in political science research regarding concept formation, operationalization, and measurement. The concept of stability means all things as various individuals attempt to measure the degree or amount of {\dq}political stability{\dq} present in their particular universe. This review essay will attempt to delineate the major approaches to the term. The concept of stability is approached by most political scientists from the behavioral point of view, in the sense that the concept can be defined and measured through reproducible and verifiable techniques. Although there are strands of common agreement in most of the literature as to the basic broad meaning of the term, confusion abounds due to the lack of due to the lack of agreement concerning the meaning of the terms employed to define {\dq}stability{\dq}; and there is also a lack of consensus regarding the operationalization of these latter terms. The differing views and approaches to political stability are seen to be: (a) the absence of violence; (b) governmental longevity/duration; (c) the existence of a legitimate constitutional regime; (d) the absence of structural change; and (e) a multifaceted societal attribute.},

The validity of the Polity III~indicators or regime type is supported by their strong correlations ( .85 to .92) with seven conceptually and operationally different indicators of democracy developed by other researchers. Comparative analysis of global and regional trends in democracy shows the extent to which the Middle East and Africa lag behind other world regions in the transition to democracy. A series of challenges to the 'third wave' of democratization are identified, with particular attention paid to the large numbers of institutionally unconsolidated, or 'incoherent', polities that have recently emerged, mainly due to attempts by autocratic elites to contain domestic and international pressures to liberalize their regimes.},

 abstract = {An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform. Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.},

 abstract = {Recent scholarship on the relationship between institutions and foreign direct investment has largely focused on the differences between democratic and autocratic regimes. While some recent studies have examined how electoral rules affect multinational investors, scant attention has been paid to the tremendous variation within autocratic regimes. In this paper we explore the theoretical argument that institutions within autocratic regimes, specifically the existence of legislatures with more than one political party, can reduce levels of political risk for multinational investors. To test the relationship between authoritarian institutions and property rights protection we utilize three different empirical tests. First, we describe the results of an original online survey of political risk insurers, plant location consultants, and risk analysts. Our survey indicates that variations in authoritarian regimes, including elected legislatures, have very little impact on property rights protections. Second, using a database from the political risk insurance industry, we find that competitive legislatures have no meaningful impact on political risk. Third, using firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys, we find that political parties and legislatures are associated with a weaker property rights regime, and higher levels of economic and regulatory policy uncertainty. Our findings cast considerable doubt that the key theoretical link between authoritarian institutions and economic growth operates through the protection of property rights.},

 abstract = {Wintrobe's (1990, 1998) dictatorship model is adapted to examine the impacts of economic sanctions on an autocrat. It is shown that the dictator's choice of the level of power, and the quantities of loyalty and repression used as inputs in the production of power, are affected by the type and magnitude of sanctions and by the impact of sanctions on the political effectiveness of opposition groups. Sanctions have direct and indirect effects on the prices of loyalty and repression as well as potentially generating rents that might be captured either by the dictator or by the opposition.

Erst in j{\"u}ngster Zeit ger{\"a}t dies auf internationaler Ebene zunehmend (wieder) ins Bewusstsein. Der Beitrag will ein Fundament f{\"u}r eine kumulative Forschung zu Autokratien legen. Daher werden wesentliche Forschungsergebnisse der Autokratieforschung der letzten Jahrzehnte vorgestellt. Auf dieser Grundlage werden die Fortschritte und verbleibenden Probleme der zeitgen{\"o}ssischen Autokratieforschung auf den Feldern der Klassifizierung von Autokratien, der Grenzziehung zwischen Demokratien und Autokratien, der Erforschung von politischen Institutionen in Autokratien sowie den Gr{\"u}nden f{\"u}r das {\"U}berdauern, aber auch das Entstehen und Zusammenbrechen von Autokratien pr{\"a}sentiert. Als gewisse Schwachpunkte der derzeitigen Autoritarismusforschung erweisen sich eine verbreitete Neigung zur Fixierung auf die Gegenwart, eine zu starke Konzentration auf nominell {\glqq}demokratische{\grqq} Institutionen sowie eine damit einhergehende Vernachl{\"a}ssigung der Bedeutung der Herrschaftslegitimation und der Repressionsinstrumente.},

 abstract = {This article evaluates the relative strengths and weaknesses of fuzzy-set analysis and regression analysis for explaining the ``great reversal'' in Spanish America. From 1750 to 1900, the most marginal colonial territories often became the region's wealthiest countries, whereas the most central colonial territories often became the region's poorest countries. To explain this reversal, five competing hypotheses are tested using both regression and fuzzy-set methods. The fuzzy-set analysis reaches substantively important conclusions, finding that strong liberal factions are probabilistically necessary for economic development and that dense indigenous populations are probabilistically necessary for social underdevelopment. By contrast, the regression analysis generates findings that are not meaningful. The article concludes that fuzzy-set analysis and regression analysis operate in different ``causal universes'' and that greater attention should be granted to the causal universe occupied by fuzzy-set analysis.},

@article{Kern.2011,
 abstract = {Do foreign media facilitate the diffusion of protest in authoritarian regimes? Apparently for the first time, the author tests this hypothesis using aggregate and survey data from communist East Germany. The aggregate-level analysis takes advantage of the fact that West German television broadcasts could be received in most but not all parts of East Germany. The author exploits this ``natural experiment'' by conducting a matched analysis in which counties without West German television are matched to a comparison group of counties with West German television. Comparing these two groups of East German counties, the author finds no evidence that West German television affected the speed or depth of protest diffusion during the 1989 East German revolution. He also analyzes a survey of East German college students. Confirming the aggregate-level results, the survey data show that, at least among college students, exposure to West German television did not increase protest participation.},

 abstract = {The devastating economic effects of the Asian financial crisis and US corporate scandals have underscored the need to strengthen corporate governance provisions. Although cronyism has been suggested as a leading cause of the two crises, it has received little attention from scholars. In this paper, we analyze the concept of cronyism and argue that it comes in various guises arising from different motivational bases and power dependence relations. We distinguish cronyism from related constructs and posit that it is a form of corruption with different dynamics from other forms. We advance propositions on its likelihood of occurrence across cultures and develop a typology of cronyist exchanges.},

 abstract = {While heated arguments between practitioners of qualitative and quantitative research have begun to test the very integrity of the social sciences, Gary King, Robert Keohane, and Sidney Verba have produced a farsighted and timely book that promises to sharpen and strengthen a wide range of research performed in this field. These leading scholars, each representing diverse academic traditions, have developed a unified approach to valid descriptive and causal inference in qualitative research, where numerical measurement is either impossible or undesirable. Their book demonstrates that the same logic of inference underlies both good quantitative and good qualitative research designs, and their approach applies equally to each. Providing precepts intended to stimulate and discipline thought, the authors explore issues related to framing research questions, measuring the accuracy of data and uncertainty of empirical inferences, discovering causal effects, and generally improving qualitative research. Among the specific topics they address are interpretation and inference, comparative case studies, constructing causal theories, dependent and explanatory variables, the limits of random selection, selection bias, and errors in measurement. Mathematical notation is occasionally used to clarify concepts, but no prior knowledge of mathematics or statistics is assumed. The unified logic of inference that this book explicates will be enormously useful to qualitative researchers of all traditions and substantive fields. -- Publisher description.},

The report outlines the various methodological challenges faced in implementing the survey and in interpreting its results, as well as steps taken to determine the quality of the data. This preliminary analysis of results from the survey lends support that the various indicators developed from the survey are reliable and valid measures of political parties' actual organizational practices, linkage mechanisms, and policy orientations.},

@article{Kohler.2008,
 abstract = {In recent years, electoral processes in non-democratic settings have been analysed either within the framework of transitology or disregarded entirely by scholars of comparative politics. Analysing the Egyptian case, this article proposes a different conceptual framework. The interaction between electoral institutions and authoritarian dynamics is conceptualized in terms of the relationship between formal and informal institutions. In the Egyptian authoritarian political system, informal mechanisms of neopatrimonial rule not only take precedence over formalized rules and procedures but integrate formal electoral institutions into the authoritarian system. Drawing on empirical evidence from legislative elections under the rule of President Husni Mubarak, this article identifies three main functions for electoral processes in nondemocratic settings: (1) Electoral contests serve to periodically renew channels of clientelist inclusion, drawing both voters and deputies into networks of patronage culminating at the top of the political system. (2) Formal inclusion of parts of the opposition into the electoral arena enhances the range of means available to the ruling elite in order to control these actors. (3) Pitted against each other in electoral contests, individual members of the ruling elite's lower echelons are effectively controlled and tied to the informal structures of rule. Thus, the principal traits of the Egyptian neopatrimonial regime remain unchanged, with formal electoral processes subverted by informal institutions of authoritarian rule to an extent as to fulfil distinctly authoritarian functions.},

Despite the fact that the composition of all of these legislatures is the result of authoritarian elections, the average effective number of legislative parties (ENLP) varies from 1 to above 8 in different countries of the region. The argument takes the form of a `nested analysis' (Lieberman 2005): First, I fit multivariate OLS regression models to an original dataset of authoritarian elections and legislatures in the MENA encompassing 47 elections and 204 country year observations. I demonstrate that the inclusion of regime type variables distinguishing between civilian dictatorships on the one hand and military or monarchical regimes on the other significantly improves the explanatory power of the model even if alternative explanatory variables are controlled for. In the second part, I analyze five exemplary cases in more depth. The aim of this second step is to flesh out the explanatory hypotheses that emerged from the quantitative analysis in the first part and to hypothesize about the causal mechanisms involved. I argue that strategies of coalition management specific to the respective authoritarian subtype are major explanatory factors. By way of conclusion, I summarize my main findings and point to some unresolved issues in the argument.},

Our political claims approach extends the sample of contentious actions beyond protest event analysis by coding institutional and civil society actors, and conventional and discursive action forms, in addition to protests by movement actors. This redefines the research object to acts of political claims making in a multi-organizational field. We use examples from a research project on mobilization about migration and ethnic relations in Britain and Germany to demonstrate the analytic gains that are possible with our approach. By situating protest and social movements, not just theoretically but also methodologically, in a wider context of political claims making, we are in a better position to follow the recent calls for more integrated approaches, which place protest within multi-organizational fields, link it to political opportunities and outcomes, andare sensitive to discursive messages.},

Indeed, only when large numbers of Iranians began to think the unthinkable, in the words of the U.S. ambassador, did revolutionary expectations become a self-fulfilling prophecy. A corrective to 20-20 hindsight, this book reveals shortcomings of analyses that make the Iranian revolution or any major protest movement seem inevitable in retrospect.{\dq}--Jacket.},

 abstract = {What are the most important sources of institutional variation among authoritarian regimes, and how do such institutions influence these dictatorships' propensity to initiate military disputes? This article argues that most existing studies in both comparative politics and international relations employaflawed conceptualization of authoritarian institutions. Excessive focus on the personalization or institutionalization of authoritarian regimes' decision-making procedures has distracted attention from the more critical issue of what institutions these regimes deploy to enhance social control and secure political incumbency. Since military regimes are systematically less effective than single-party regimes at developing these types of authoritarian institutions, they more frequently resort to desperate measures to fend off domestic challenges to their power. In particular,we find compelling empirical support for our hypothesis that military regimes are more likely than single-party regimes to initiate military disputes, irrespective of whether those regimes are highly personalized or not.},

 abstract = {Are violators of international human rights norms punished with lower levels of foreign aid? Despite

their abstract preferences, governments often lack the incentive to punish norm violators bilaterally.

Multilateral lending institutions, such as the World Bank, could fill the void if they wanted to consider

human rights abuses and could bypass restrictions on evaluating the political character of recipients.

This article argues that `shaming' in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, through

resolutions that explicitly criticized governments for their human rights records, provided substantive

information about rights abuses and gave political cover for the World Bank and other liberal multilateral

aid institutions seeking to sanction human rights violators. Statistical analyses support these

theoretical claims. The adoption of a UNCHR resolution condemning a country's human rights record

produced a sizeable reduction in multilateral, and especially World Bank, aid but had no effect on the

country's aggregate bilateral aid receipts. The analyses also support predictions that `objective' measures

of human rights have no independent effect on multilateral aid allocations. The findings, which are

robust to different model techniques and specifications, suggest that punishment for violating international

human rights norms is selective, that international organizations play an important role in the

selection process and, thus, that seemingly symbolic resolutions of a politically motivated IO can carry

tangible consequences.},

The military possesses coercive resources that can suppress any challenge to authoritarian rule. This article explains why and under what conditions militaries in authoritarian regimes, when faced with popular demonstrations, will support the path of political liberalization. The study argues that armed forces are likely to back transitions from authoritarianism when there is intense conflict within the military; and arising fromthese contestations,marginalized officers (losers) either enter into a pact with the domestic opposition or have foreign support to act against the regime. The losers' decision to turn against authoritarianismis amove to eliminate the regime and their rivals within the armed forces.

@article{Lektzian.2007,
 abstract = {Why do economic sanctions sometimes succeed, but often fail, to produce a policy change? The authors argue that the effect of economic punishment is conditional on a state's political institutions. In all cases, the key to sanctions success is to generate political costs for the target regime's winning coalition. However, because of different institutional incentives, economically punishing sanctions are less likely to succeed against a nondemocratic target than against a democratic target. Sanctions increase rents. This benefits nondemocratic leaders more than democratic ones. Also, nondemocratic leaders have smaller winning coalitions, so their core constituents suffer less from sanctions than democratic leaders. Additionally, the authors' strategic argument leads to novel hypotheses regarding the initiation of sanctions. They test hypotheses from their political cost argument against all dyadic sanctions cases between 1948 and 1990, using two different dependent variables and a censored selection estimator to take into account the strategic nature of sanctioning.},

Although both leverage and linkage raise the cost of authoritarianism, linkage contributes more consistently to democratization. Extensive linkage contributes to democratization even under unfavorable domestic conditions. Where linkage and leverage are low, external democratizing pressure is minimal, and domestic forces predominate. Where linkage is low but leverage high, external pressure is intermittent and partially effective. Slovakia, Mexico, Russia, and Zambia are examined.},

Based on a detailed study of 35 cases in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and post-communist Eurasia, this book explores the fate of competitive authoritarian regimes between 1990 and 2008. It finds that where social, economic, and technocratic ties to the West were extensive, as in Eastern Europe and the Americas, the external cost of abuse led incumbents to cede power rather than crack down, which led to democratization. Where ties to the West were limited, external democratizing pressure was weaker and countries rarely democratized. In these cases, regime outcomes hinged on the character of state and ruling party organizations. Where incumbents possessed developed and cohesive coercive party structures, they could thwart opposition challenges, and competitive authoritarian regimes survived; where incumbents lacked such organizational tools, regimes were unstable but rarely democratized{\dq}--},

@article{Li.2003,
 abstract = {The theoretical literature presents conflicting expectations about the effect of globalization on national democratic governance. One view expects globalization to enhance democracy; a second argues the opposite; a third argues globalization does not necessarily affect democracy. Progress in explaining how globalization affects democracy requires confronting these theoretical positions with data. We assess empirically the effects of globalization on the level of democracy from 1970 to 1996 for 127 countries in a pooled time-series cross-sectional statistical model. The effects of four national aspects of globalization on democracy are examined: trade openness, foreign direct investment inflows, portfolio investment inflows and the spread of democratic ideas across countries. We find that trade openness and portfolio investment inflows negatively affect democracy. The effect of trade openness is constant over time while the negative effect of portfolio investment strengthens. Foreign direct investment inflows positively affect democracy, but the effect weakens over time. The spread of democratic ideas promotes democracy persistently over time. These patterns are robust across samples, various model specifications, alternative measures of democracy and several statistical estimators. We conclude with a discussion of policy implications.},

 abstract = {Aggregate data studies of domestic political conflict have used an Action-Reaction (AR) model that has produced contradictory findings about the repression/dissent nexus: Repression by regimes may either increase or decrease dissent by opposition groups. To clarify these findings I propose an alternative Rational Actor (RA) model from which are derived three propositions. (1) An increase in a government's repression of nonviolence will reduce the nonviolent activities of an opposition group but increase its violent activities. (2) The balance of effects, that is, whether an increase in the regime's repression increases or decreases the opposition group's total dissident activities, depends upon the government's accommodative policy to the group. (3) Consistent government accommodative and repressive policies reduce dissent; inconsistent policies increase dissent. The RA model thus accounts for the contradictory findings produced by the AR-based aggregate data studies of repression and dissent.},

 abstract = {Despite repeated calls for the use of ``mixed methods'' in comparative analysis, political scientists have few systematic guides for carrying out such work. This paper details a unified approach which joins intensive case-study analysis with statistical analysis. Not only are the advantages of each approach combined, but also there is a synergistic value to the nested research design: for example, statistical analyses can guide case selection for in-depth research, provide direction for more focused case studies and comparisons, and be used to provide additional tests of hypotheses generated from small-N research. Small-N analyses can be used to assess the plausibility of observed statistical relationships between variables, to generate theoretical insights from outlier and other cases, and to develop better measurement strategies. This integrated strategy improves the prospects of making valid causal inferences in cross-national and other forms of comparative research by drawing on the distinct strengths of two important approaches.},

Turning this common wisdom on its head, this book demonstrates the vitality, variety, and significance of political activism across the MENA region. Through an in-depth exploration of seven countries, the authors address how formal and informal political institutions create opportunities for participation in venues as varied as trade unions, civic associations, political parties, and elections. And, without losing sight of the fact that authoritarian regimes manipulate participation to reinforce their rule, they reveal ways in which citizens do benefit - by influencing decision-making, for example, or obtaining state resources. An engaging read for scholars and students, this work vividly illustrates how citizens matter in the politics of authoritarian regimes. It reveals the variety and significance of political participation across the Middle East and North Africa in the face of authoritarian rule.},

 abstract = {This article reconsiders the relationship between authoritarian elections and democratization. Examining legislative elections in the Middle East, it argues that elections are best understood as ``competitive clientelism,'' a competition between elites over privileged access to a limited set of state resources that they can then distribute to their clients. This drives the behavior of voters and candidates in systematic ways that promote pro-regime parliaments and allows incumbent elites to manage elections largely through institutional rules rather than extralegal manipulation. Elections thus provide an efficient mechanism for the distribution of patronage---easing the state elites' ability to reward local elites, and creating a belief that even if they are unable to gain access to state resources today, they have the opportunity to do so in the future. The article concludes by considering mechanisms that may more effectively help to foster democratization, given the logic of authoritarian elections},

We find support for the adverse effect of the debt burden on ``capital expenditure'' in the full sample and in the Middle East-North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa subsamples where the debt burden was relatively high. Among components of ``current expenditure,'' increased debt burden shifted the shares against ``nonwage goods services'' and ``subsidy and transfers'' while leaving the share of politically sensitive category of ``wages and salaries'' unscathed in most cases.},

Although it is widely recognized that the selection of negative cases is consequential for theory testing, methodologists have yet to formulate specific rules to inform this selection process. In this paper, we propose a principle-the Possibility Principle-that provides explicit, rigorous, and theoretically informed guidelines for choosing a set of negative cases. The Possibility Principle advises researchers to select only negative cases where the outcome of interest is possible. Our discussion elaborates this principle and its implications for current debates about case selection and strategies of theory testing. Majorpoints are illustrated with substantive examples from studies of revolution, economic growth, welfare states, and war.},

But the problems confronting these new democracies are staggering, and the prospects for building consolidated democratic regimes are far from uniformly good. Focusing primarily on recent South American cases, Issues in Democratic Consolidation examines some of the difficulties of constructing consolidated democracies and provides a critical examination of the major issues involved. A prominent theme running through this collection is that the transitions from authoritative rule to civilian government may be arrested by political, economic, and social constraints. The articles contain analyses of the varied modalities and complex processes related to the transitions. The first transition begins with the initial stirrings of crisis under authoritarian rule that generate some form of political opening and greater respect for basic civil rights, and ends with the establishment of a government elected in an open, competitive contest. The volumes primary focus, however, is on the second transition, which begins with the inauguration of a democratic government and ends - if all goes well - with the establishment of a consolidated democratic regime.},

We make five general claims about regime classification. First, regime classification should rest on sound concepts and definitions. Second, it should be based on explicit and sensible coding and aggregation rules. Third, it necessarily involves some subjective judgments. Fourth, the debate about dichotomous versus continuous measures of democracy creates a false dilemma. Neither democratic theory, nor coding requirements, nor the reality underlying democratic practice compel either a dichotomous or a continuous approach in all cases. Fifth, dichotomous measures of democracy fail to capture intermediate regime types, obscuring variation that is essential for studying political regimes.

This general discussion provides the grounding for our trichotomous ordinal scale, which codes regimes as democratic, semi-democratic or authoritarian in nineteen Latin American countries from 1945 to 1999. Our trichotomous classification achieves greater differentiation than dichotomous classifications and yet avoids the need for massive information that a very fine-grained measure would require.},

The first section of the paper argues that little work in comparative politics has shown that regions are sometimes important units of analysis. In sections two and three we illustrate causal heterogeneity, showing that the effects of per capita income on democracy have been different in Latin America than in other regions of the world. Sections four and five address intra-regional dissemination and diffusion of democratic and authoritarian regimes. For Latin America, intraregional dissemination has been stronger than cross-regional dissemination, and we briefly explore the reasons for this phenomenon. We emphasize the need to avoid simplistic generalizations about regions as homogeneous entities while at the same time giving them a prominent role in some research questions. At a broad methodological level, regional specificities suggest the need for caution about universalistic generalizations and indicate the need to consider causal heterogeneity, domain restrictions, and bounded generalizations.},

 abstract = {Do economic sanctions destabilize the governments they target? A form of foreign pressure, sanctions are typically meant to alter the policies of other countries. There is much pessimism on whether they ever work. This article shows that economic pressure works in at least one respect: it destabilizes the leaders it targets. I present a theoretical argument that explains why destabilization is a necessary condition for successful coercion. I find evidence that pressure destabilizes in a large panel of cross-country time-series data. The destabilization finding indicates that sanctions may be more effective at altering policies than we think. I conclude by noting that greater optimism regarding the effectiveness of sanctions should be balanced by a careful consideration of the policy's real and sizeable costs for those caught in the middle.},

 abstract = {Dissatisfied with the compartmentalization of studies concerning strikes, wars, revolutions, social movements, and other forms of political struggle, McAdam, Tarrow, and Tilly identify causal mechanisms and processes that recur across a wide range of contentious politics. Critical of the static, single-actor models (including their own) that have prevailed in the field, they shift the focus of analysis to dynamic interaction. Doubtful that large, complex series of events such as revolutions and social movements conform to general laws, they break events into smaller episodes, then identify recurrent mechanisms and proceses within them. Dynamics of Contention examines and compares eighteen contentious episodes drawn from many different parts of the world since the French Revolution, probing them for consequential and widely applicable mechanisms, for example, brokerage, category formation, and elite defection. The episodes range from nineteenth-century nationalist movements to contemporary Muslim-Hindu conflict to the Tiananmen crisis of 1989 to disintegration of the Soviet Union.; The authors spell out the implications of their approach for explanation of revolutions, nationalism, and democratization, then lay out a more general program for study of contentious episodes wherever and whenever they occur.},

@article{Merkel.2004,
 abstract = {In the literature on democratization the mainstream of theoretical and empirical consolidology uses the dichotomy autocracy versus democracy. Democracy is generally conceived of as `electoral democracy'. This simple dichotomy does not allow a distinction between consolidated liberal democracies and their diminished sub-types. However, over half of all the new electoral democracies represent specific variants of diminished sub-types of democracy, which can be called defective democracies. Starting from the root concept of embedded democracies, which consists of five interdependent partial regimes (electoral regime, political rights, civil rights, horizontal accountability, effective power to govern), the article distinguishes between four diminished subtypes of defective democracy: exclusive democracy, illiberal democracy, delegative democracy and tutelary democracy. It can be shown that defective democracies are by no means necessarily transitional regimes. They tend to form stable links to their economic and societal environment and are often seen by considerable parts of the elites and the population as an adequate institutional solution to the specific problems of governing `effectively'. As long as this equilibrium between problems, context and power lasts, defective democracies will survive for protracted periods of time.},

@article{Merkel.2010,
 abstract = {Since 2007 an increasing number of articles have diagnosed `freedom in retreat' and predicted a `return to the authoritarian great powers'. Highly distinguished scholars warn against the `democratic rollback', and articles on the resilience of authoritarian regimes have appeared in the best journals of political science. Is the tide of democratization turning, and do we have to expect a new reverse wave of autocratization? This article argues that there is no hard empirical evidence that we are witnessing a trend towards re-autocratization on a global scale. The optimism of the early 1990s of a seemingly irresistible trend towards democracy is partially due to an empirical artefact caused by inappropriate underlying theoretical concepts. The overestimation of human agency and political crafting on the one side and underestimation of structural impediments for democracy on the other side contributed to this optimism, as did the thin concept of `electoral democracy' or teleological speculation about the end of history. Democratic rollback does not seem to be as widespread as is sometimes claimed.},

However, cross-temporal changes in the relationships have remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine several hypotheses about the diachronical dynamics of such structural conditions on autocracy using a sliding series of statistical analyses, covering 167 countries from 1973 to 2007. First, we propose that -- due to the advent of liberal hegemony following the end of the Cold War -- structural factors generally do not account for the presence of autocracies as much today as what was the case at recently as in the 1980s. Our empirical analysis shows that this proposition can only be corroborated in part. On this basis, we argue that liberal hegemony has had an asymmetrical impact on the structural conditions of autocracy. More particularly, while it is likely to have diminished the effect of Neighbor diffusion and Modernization, we expect the variables of being oil reliant and having a Muslim majority to be largely resistant to the impact of liberal hegemony. This assertion finds more empirical backing.},

In this article, we venture down that road, in turn assessing whether structural factors that have been highlighted as necessary for democracy are sufficient for autocracy in the context of the so-called third wave of democratization. Based on current writings on democratization, one would not expect this to be case. What is more, the tendency of the structural factors to be sufficient should be even less pronounced following the breakdown of communism. However, using fuzzy-set QCA on data covering the period 1972-2008, we show that neither of these expectations survives an empirical reality check. In gist, a number of sufficient conditions of autocracy can in fact be indentified and -- counter-intuitively -- the extent to which a number of them condition autocracy has increased, not decreased, over the period. We provide some tentative hypotheses to make sense of these findings.},

 abstract = {Rational choice theory tends to viewpolitical institutions as structures of voluntary cooperation that resolve collective action problems and benefit all concerned. Yet the political process often gives rise to institutions that are good for some people and bad for others, depending on who has the power to impose their will. Political institutions may be structures of cooperation, but they may also be structures of power---and the theory does not tell us much about this. As a result, it gives us a one-sided and overly benign view of what political institutions are and do. This problem is not well understood, and indeed is not typically seen as a problem at all. For there is a widespread sense in the rational choice literature that, because power is frequently discussed, it is an integral part of the theory and just as fundamental as cooperation. Confusion on this score has undermined efforts to right the imbalance.My purpose here is to clarify the analytic roles that power and cooperation actually play in this literature, and to argue that a more balanced theory---one that brings power fromits periphery to its very core---is both necessary and entirely possible.},

@misc{Moller.2011,
 abstract = {In two recent retrospectives -- marking the 25th anniversary of the publication of Transitions From

Authoritarian Rule -- Schmitter and O‟Donnell argue that the easy spread of democracy in the latest

decades has much to do with its bare-bones character. Based on these interventions and on other

recent contributions, we pose three interrelated propositions: First, structural factors today impact the level of democracy more when it is understood in a relatively {\glqq}thin‟ (minimalistic) way than

when it is understood in a relatively {\glqq}thick‟ (maximalistic) way. Second, this asymmetrical pattern

has been on the increase over the latest decades. Third, the years 1989-91 constitute a crucial

breaking point in this respect. Even though these -- or very similar -- claims are frequently put

forward in the literature, they have not been subjected to a systematic, large-N empirical appraisal

yet. We do so by employing a two-step approach. In the first step, we test the extent to which a set

of structural factors impact thin and thick types of democracy differently today. Second, based on a

somewhat cruder measurement of thin and thick types of democracy, we expand the analysis to the whole period of the third wave, using a sliding series of OLS-regressions. These analyses, covering

virtually all countries from 1973 and onwards, lend support to all the three propositions.},

 abstract = {Why is government corruption more pervasive in some societies than in others? In this article we examine public choice explanations that attribute corruption to a lack of competition in either political or economic arenas or both. The principal part of our analysis draws on recentlypublished data about levels of corruption for a broad cross-section of countries reported for the early 1980s. We supplement this with an additional analysis of a second dataset on corruption measured during the late 1980s. Our analyses confirm that political competition affects level of corruption, but this effect is nonlinear. Corruption is typically lower in dictatorships than in countries that have partially democratized. But once past a threshold, democratic practices inhibit corruption. However, we obtained mixed results with respect to the relationship of economic competition and corruption: government size does not systematically affect corruption, but membership of the Oil Producing and Exporting Countries (OPEC) does. Finally, corruption is more pervasive in low-income countries which tend to underpay public sector employees.},

Are there actually sets of stabilized, political institutions that can be labelled in this way? Is it possible that within the widespread process of democracy diffusion these are only `transitional' regimes and the most suitable distinction is still the old one, suggested by Linz and traditionally accepted, between democracy and authoritarianism? This article addresses and responds to these questions by pinpointing the pertinent analytic dimensions, starting with definitions of `regime', `authoritarianism', and `democracy'; by defining what a `hybrid

regime' is; by trying to answer the key question posed in the title; by disentangling the cases of proper hybrid regimes from the cases of transitional phases; and by proposing a typology of hybrid regimes. Some of the main findings and conclusions refer to the lack of institutions capable of performing their functions as well as the key elements for achieving possible changes towards democracy.},

@article{Muller.1991,
 abstract = {Discontent theories of rebellion postulate that politicized discontent will have a strong independent effect on individuals' potential to participate in rebellious political action. Expected utility theories postulate that participation in rebellious action is motivated by expectation of reward and that discontent is relevant at most only insofar as individuals expect that collective action can be successful and that their participation is important to that end. We test these theories with data from a national sample and a sample of students at a protest-prone university in Peru, a country with significant objective conditions of discontent and a high incidence of rebellious political conflict. The results provide no evidence for the discontent models but strong support for the expected utility models. The potential for participation in rebellious political action proves to be a function primarily of discontent weighted by the expectancy of the action's success and the perceived importance of personal participation. Private social and normative rewards and costs also are relevant--but to a lesser extent--for the individual's calculation of the expected utility of participation.},

argue that previous studies of sanctions ignore the problem of strategic censoring by

focusing only on cases of observed sanctions. In this paper, I develop a unified

model of sanction imposition and success and test it using a simultaneous equation

censored probit model. This selection-corrected sanction model finds that the process

by which sanctions are imposed is linked to the process by which some succeed

while others fail, and that the unmeasured factors that lead to sanction imposition

are negatively related to their success.},

 abstract = {This article concerns the relationship between the temporal and spatial aspects of democratic diffusion in the world system since 1946. We show strong and consistent evidence of temporal clustering of democratic and autocratic trends as well as strong spatial association (or autocorrelation) of democratization. The analysis uses an exploratory data approach in a longitudinal framework to understand global and regional trends in changes in authority structures. Our work reveals discrete changes in regimes that run counter to the dominant aggregate trends of democratic waves or sequences, demonstrating how the ebb and flow of democracy varies among the world's regions. We conclude that further analysis of the process of regime change from autocracy to democracy, as well as reversals, should start from a ``domain-specific'' position that disaggregates the globe into its regional mosaics.},

 abstract = {It is often underlined that African oil-producing countries are politically unstable as a result of the role that this resource can play in political incentives. Based on data documenting the duration in office of heads of state of 26 African countries (North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa), this study reveals a surprising twist on the conventional wisdom: The purported instability of African oil-producing countries does not appear to extend to the executive branch of the state. Conversely, using survival analysis, this research suggests a positive link between oil rents and the duration in office of African leaders. Findings also reveal that other mineral rents do not exhibit the same stabilizing effect. The author's interpretation of these results is grounded in an analysis of the practicalities of oil investment and the strategic aspect of oil.},

@article{Opp.1990,
 abstract = {Several major theories - deprivation theory, resource mobilization theory, and the theory of collective action - make different predictions about the effects of repression on political protest. The results of empirical research have been inconclusive as well: some studies have found that repression deters protest, whereas others have found a positive (radicalizing) effect of repression on protest. This article proposes a model that explains the different effects of repression, in conjunction with other incentives, on political protest. We first hypothesize that repression has a direct negative (deterring) effect on protest because repression is a cost. This direct effect may be endorsed under some conditions, or it may be neutralized, or even reversed if repression leads to micromobilization processes that raise incentives for protest. These processes are set in motion if persons are exposed to repression, if repression is considered illegitimate by these persons and their social environment (which holds in case of legal protest), and if these persons are members of groups that support protest. Under such conditions repression indirectly increases protest by launching micromobilization processes. These processes and their effects are specified in a model which is tested and confirmed by a panel study of opponents of nuclear power in West Germany.},

 abstract = {The governance of natural resources used by many individuals in common is an issue of increasing concern to policy analysts. Both state control and privatization of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. After critiquing the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr. Ostrom first describes three models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market solutions. She then outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to these models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways--both successful and unsuccessful--of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organizations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.},

In addition, in the spirit of Manski, contextual and correlated effects in a multilevel framework are defined to detect group effects.

We employ a new dataset of political transitions during the Third Wave of Democratisation and examine the within effect of democratisation in countries that abandoned autocracy and consolidated representative institutions. The panel estimates imply that on average democratisations are associated with a 1{\%} increase in annual per capita growth. The dynamic analysis reveals that: while during the transition growth is slow, in the medium and long run it stabilises at a higher level. This evidence favours development theories of democratic rule and Friedrich Hayek (1960)s idea that the merits of democracy appear in the long run.},

If economic sanctions weaken the target regime's coercive capacity, human rights violations by the government should be less likely. If, on the contrary, sanctions fail to attenuate the coercive capacity of the target elites and create more economic difficulties and political violence among ordinary citizens, the government will likely commit more human rights violations. Focusing on competing views of why sanctions might improve or deteriorate human rights conditions, this article offers an empirical examination of the effect sanctions have on the physical integrity rights of citizens in target countries. Utilizing time-series, cross-national  data for the period 1981---2000, the findings suggest that economic sanctions worsen government respect for physical integrity rights, including freedom from disappearances, extra-judicial killings, torture, and political imprisonment. The results also show that extensive sanctions are more detrimental to human rights than partial/selective sanctions. Economic coercion remains a counterproductive policy tool, even when sanctions are specifically  imposed with the goal of improving human rights. Finally, multilateral sanctions have a greater overall negative impact on human rights than unilateral sanctions.},

difficult---and often arbitrary---decision to use one existing democracy scale over another in favor of a cumulative approach that allows us to simultaneously leverage the measurement efforts of numerous scholars. The result of this cumulative approach is a measure of democracy that, for every country-year, is at least as reliable as the most reliable component measure and is accompanied by quantitative estimates of uncertainty in the level of democracy. Moreover, for those who wish to continue using previously existing scales or to evaluate research performed using those scales, we extract information from the new measure to perform heretofore impossible direct comparisons between component scales. Specifically, we estimate the relative reliability of the constituent indicators, compare the specific ordinal levels of each of the existing measures in relationship to one another and

assess overall levels of disagreement across raters. We make the UDS and associated parameter estimates freely available online and provide a detailed tutorial that demonstrates how to best use the UDS in applied work.},

This article conceptualizes path dependence as a social process grounded in a dynamic of {\dq}increasing returns.{\dq} Reviewing recent literature in economics and suggesting extensions to the world of politics, the article demonstrates that increasing returns processes are likely to be prevalent, and that good analyticalfoundations exist for exploring their causes and consequences. The investigation of increasing returns can provide a more rigorous framework for developing some of the key claims of recent scholarship in historical institutionalism: Specific patterns of timing and sequence matter; a wide range of social outcomes may be possible; large consequences may result from relatively small or contingent events; particular courses of action, once introduced, can be almost impossible to reverse; and consequently, political development is punctuated by critical moments or junctures that shape the basic contours of social life.},

We contribute to current debates on qualitative research designs by using Monte Carlo experiments to evaluate the performance of different case selection techniques or algorithms. We show that causal inference from qualitative research becomes more reliable when researchers select cases from a larger sample, maximize the variation in the variable of interest, simultaneously minimize variation of the confounding factors, and ignore all information on the dependent variable. We also demonstrate that causal inferences from qualitative research become much less reliable when the variable of interest is strongly correlated with confounding factors, the effect of the variable of interest becomes small relative to the effect of the confounding factors, and when researchers analyze dichotomous dependent variables.},

These are: absorption of cross-sectional variance by unit dummies, absorption of time-series variance by the lagged dependent variable and period dummies, mis-specification of the lag structure, and neglect of parameter slope heterogeneity. Based on this discussion, we suggest substantial changes of the estimation approach and the estimated model. Employing our preferred methodological stance,we demonstrate that Garrett and Mitchell's findings are not robust. Instead, we show that partisan politics and socioeconomic factors such as aging and unemployment as expected by theorists have a strong impact on the timeseries and cross-sectional variance in government spending.},

Several of our findings differ from those of our earlier work. Here we find statistical evidence that military regimes lead to somewhat greater human rights abuse, defined in terms of violations of personal integrity, once democracy and a host of other factors are controlled. Further, we find that countries that have experienced British colonial influence tend to have relatively fewer abuses of personal integrity rights than others. Finally, our results suggest that leftist countries are actually less repressive of these basic human rights than non-leftist countries. Consistent with the Poe and Tate (1994) study, however, we find that past levels of repression, democracy, population size, economic development, and international and civil wars exercise statistically significant and substantively important impacts on personal integrity abuse.},

Although the focus is on individual countries, this book also provides a stimulating text on comparative electoral history by looking at electoral culture and traditions, electoral participation, electoral fraud, the role of elections in the process of nation-building, and the role of important institutions, such as the Church, in shaping political values and therefore electoral behaviour. It brings together fresh research from various area specialists, offering alternative views to the understanding of elections in pre-modern, pre-democratic societies. Finally, it attempts to show that electoral practices and institutions, however imperfect, were a necessary pre-condition for the development of representative forms of government.

Pariah regimes in transition is one category that needs exploring, focusing as it does on the international dimension of regime change. A thematic framework is developed for exploring this phenomenon which is now more visible given tighter conditionality demands by international organizations. This is applied to four cases in Central and Eastern Europe (Belarus, Romania, Croatia and Serbia) and then, in greater detail, to Slovakia which became renowned for its flouting of political conditionality. It is found that these cases are variable examples of pariah regimes, but their commonalities include substantial issues most likely to provoke European opinion, a high level of personalization of pariah status and a significant influence of international pressures. Also, on the one hand, these pressures may be reduced when security interests of outside powers so dictate; on the other hand, the pull of the `European core' -- in particular, the European Union -- has a reinforcing effect on democratization, thus tending to demarcate Central and Eastern Europe from most ex-Soviet republics.},

{\dq}The political institutions under which we live today evolved from a revolutionary idea that shook the world in the second part of the eighteenth century: that a people should govern itself. Yet if we judge contemporary democracies by the ideals of self-government, equality, and liberty, we find that democracy is not what it was dreamt to be. This book addresses central issues in democratic theory by analyzing the sources of widespread dissatisfaction with democracies around the world. With attention throughout to historical and cross-national variations, the focus is on the generic limits of democracy in promoting equality, effective participation, control of governments by citizens, and liberty. The conclusion is that although some of this dissatisfaction has good reasons, some is based on an erroneous understanding of how democracy functions. Hence, although the analysis identifies the limits of democracy, it also points to directions for feasible reforms{\dq}--Provided by publisher.},

@article{Quan.2003,
 abstract = {The theoretical literature presents conflicting expectations about the effect of globalization on national democratic governance. One view expects globalization to enhance democracy; a second argues the opposite; a third argues globalization does not necessarily affect democracy. Progress in explaining how globalization affects democracy requires confronting these theoretical positions with data. We assess empirically the effects of globalization on the level of democracy from 1970 to 1996 for 127 countries in a pooled time-series cross-sectional model. The effects of four national aspects of globalization on democracy are examined: trade openness, foreign direct investment inflows, portfolio investment inflows and the spread of democratic ideas across countries. We find that trade openness and portfolio investment inflows negatively affect democracy. The effect of trade openness is constant over time while the negative effect of portfolio investment strengthens. Foreign direct investment inflows positively affect democracy, but the effect weakens over time. The spread of democratic ideas promotes democracy persistently over time. These patterns are robust across samples, various model specifications, alternative measures of democracy and several statistical estimators. We conclude with a discussion of policy implications.},

@article{Quinlivan.1999,
 abstract = {A number of Middle Eastern states--e.g., Iraq, Syria, and Saudi Arabia--seem to be {\dq}coup-proof.{\dq} That is, their regimes have created structures that minimize the possibility that a small group can seize power. These include effectively exploiting family, ethnic, and religious loyalties; creation of an armed force parallel to the regular military; development of multiple internal security agencies with overlapping jurisdiction that constantly monitor one another; fostering of expertness in the regular military; and adequately financing such measures. The regime is thus able to create an army that is effectively larger than one drawn solely from trustworthy segments of the population. These measures, however, lessen the states' usable military power. Nonetheless, Iraq has demonstrated the ability of a coup-proofed regime to survive despite overwhelming military defeat. Key surviving military and security elements, their loyalty to the regime, and their organized firepower won out over the poorly armed civilians and broken military units that opposed them following Iraq's defeat in the Gulf War.},

This article discusses these problems and introduces a dataset designed to overcome them -- an expanded and updated version of the Political Regime Change dataset, which was designed specifically for the task of classifying regime types and transitions. Although the Political Regime Change dataset is comparable to existing datasets that measure institutional and political characteristics, its use of a broader set of indicators and categories by which to classify regimes creates important differences. The importance of this broader classification scheme becomes increasingly apparent in many `third wave' transitions, where semi-democracies have been a common outcome of regime change.},

Elite coalitions organized under the aegis of a hegemonic party are most vulnerable in elections that coincide with poor economic performance. A declining economy provides elites with a platform around which they can mobilize support to challenge incumbents in elections. As a result, the likelihood of defections from hegemonic parties increases as income declines. This study's original dataset, which includes 227 elections for the chief executive in hegemonic party dictatorships from 1946 to 2004, and its case studies of defections in Zimbabwe under ZANU-PF in 2008 and Turkey under the Democratic Party in 1955 provide evidence for this proposition.},

 abstract = {The third wave of democratization and the end of the cold war significantly altered the map of political regimes around the world. Generally speaking, we can now distinguish between five different regime types: closed authoritarianism, hegemonic authoritarianism, competitive authoritarianism, electoral democracy, and liberal democracy. This paper develops a coding system to categorize countries as belonging to one of these five regime types in any given year. It then applies these criteria to countries around the world from 1990 to 2005, thus yielding both annual and election-year data for each country. The rest of the paper documents and analyzes the trends in regime type frequency and proportion during this time period. Among other findings, the crossnational data show that competitive authoritarian regimes are by far the most volatile, which we argue is due to the destabilizing effect of elections on these regime types.},

and roll call votes is that contributions rarely matter because groups tend to give

to like-minded legislators. This meta-analysis examines the conventional wisdom

by analyzing published research on this topic. Methods. More than 30 studies are

pooled to produce more than 350 individual tests of the contributions-roll call link.

Extending meta-regression (Stanley and Jarrell, 1989), a logit meta-analysis is conducted

to summarize the literature and assess the importance of various modeling

choices. Results. We find that some, but not all, model specifications have an

impact on whether significant results are present. Models that control for friendly

giving by including a measure of legislators' ideology and that include more than

one contributions variable are less likely to produce significant results. Conclusions.

After considering the impact of model choice on study results, we conclude

that one-third of roll call votes exhibit the impact of campaign contributions.},

 abstract = {{\dq}All forms of government require popular support, whether voluntary or involuntary, in order to survive. Following the collapse of the Soviet system, Russia's rulers took steps toward democracy, yet under Vladimir Putin Russia has become increasingly undemocratic. This book uses a unique source of evidence, 18 surveys of Russian public opinion from the first month of the new regime in 1992 up to 2009, to track the changing views of Russians. Clearly presented and sophisticated figures and tables show how political support has increased because of a sense of resignation that is stronger than the unstable benefits of exporting oil and gas. Whilst comparative analyses of surveys on other continents show that Russia's elite is not alone in being able to mobilize popular support for an undemocratic regime, Russia provides an outstanding caution that popular support can grow when governors reject democracy and create an undemocratic regime{\dq}--},

@article{Ross.2001,
 abstract = {Some scholars suggest that the Middle East's oil wealth helps explain its failure to democratize. This article examines three aspects of this {\dq}oil impedes democracy{\dq} claim. First, is it true? Does oil have a consistently antidemocratic effect on states, once other factors are accounted for? Second, can this claim be generalized? Is it true only in the Middle East or elsewhere as well? Is it true for other types of mineral wealth and other types of commodity wealth or only for oil? Finally, if oil does have antidemocratic properties, what is the causal mechanism? The author uses pooled time-series cross-national data from 113 states between 1971 and 1997 to show that oil exports are strongly associated with authoritarian rule; that this effect is not limited to the Middle East; and that other types of mineral exports have a similar antidemocratic effect, while other types of commodity exports do not. The author also tests three explanations for this pattern: a {\dq}rentier effect,{\dq} which suggests that resource-rich governments use low tax rates and patronage to dampen democratic pressures; a {\dq}repression effect,{\dq} which holds that resource wealth enables governments to strengthen their internal security forces and hence repress popular movements; and a {\dq}modernization effect,{\dq} which implies that growth that is based on the export of oil and minerals will fail to bring about the social and cultural changes that tend to produce democratic government. He finds at least limited support for all three effects.},

other countries. Oil production reduces the number of women in the labor force, which in turn reduces

their political influence. As a result, oil-producing states are left with atypically strong patriarchal norms,

laws, and political institutions. I support this argument with global data on oil production, female work

patterns, and female political representation, and by comparing oil-rich Algeria to oil-poor Morocco

and Tunisia. This argument has implications for the study of the Middle East, Islamic culture, and the

This article shows that these two trends are indeed related, but not necessarily in the direct manner that has commonly been postulated. Combining theories of embedded liberalism and conflict-based theories of democracy, the model presented here depicts the process that affects decisions to strengthen democracy as trade and capital flows increase. I argue that increasing exposure to international export and financial markets leads to improvements in democracy if safety nets are used simultaneously as a strategy for providing stability and building political support.

@article{Sandbakken.2006,
 abstract = {Rentier state theory is a set of ideas about why states with considerable natural resource wealth appear to have very similar economic and political development trajectories. This article looks more closely at the proposition that oil rentier states have specific features that make them unlikely to become consolidated democracies. It narrows down the rentier state framework to three such features: first, that rentier states do not rely on taxation for income and thus are released from democratic obligations to their taxpayers; second, that the state spends oil revenues on placating and repressing its population; and third, that the social structure in rentier states leaves very little room for democratic opposition. In comparing three African rentier states, namely Algeria, Nigeria and Libya, the article finds some sections of rentier state theory to have more explanatory value than others. In all three cases government spending on welfare and repression has helped dampen the pressures for democratization. The social structure argument seems more valid for Algeria and Nigeria than for Libya. In none of the cases does the link between taxation and representation appear to be a significant determinant of regime type. Although the study confirms that oil wealth is associated with autocracy, the causal mechanisms of rentier state theory could benefit from being refined.},

In a longitudinal data setwe study the effect of some observable economic and political conditions on the hazard rate of different types of political regimes.We find that economic development has a stabilizing effect in countries with democratic political institutions, but rich autocracies do not show a lower hazard rate than less developed autocracies. While the stability of autocracies is not affected by their degree of economic development, it is greatly associated with the degree of popular discontent.Widespread discontent with leaders in autocratic regimes highly increases their hazard rate. This relationship is much weaker for regimes with democratic institutions. We also find a non-monotonic time dependence pattern for the hazard rate of political regimes. Political regimes are found to be at an increasing risk of collapse during the first years, with their hazard rates reaching a peak around the fourth year},

This article suggests that the involvement of democracy advocates helps to drive variation in Central Asia's authoritarian regimes. The role that these advocates play in the region, in turn, may be traced in part to unintended consequences. Specifically, elites made early choices about how to frame the legitimacy of the state, which, in turn, set the parameters for their maneuver in subsequent political transformations.},

@article{Schneider.2004,
 abstract = {This article measures the process of democratization by subdividing it into three components: the liberalization of autocracy, the mode of transition and the consolidation of democracy. The 30 or so countries included in the study are situated in different world regions, mainly southern and eastern Europe, south and central America and the former Soviet Union -- all of which have experienced regime transitions since 1974. The study also includes a sample of countries from the Middle East and northern Africa that are, at best, only in an embryonic stage of liberalization. Measured by scalograms, the data provide comparative indicators of the progress each country has achieved over the period 1974--2000. The study tests this time series for `patterns', guided by the hypothesis that the multiple dimensions of liberalization, transition and consolidation are consistently related to each other, both temporally and spatially. The findings indicate a single underlying dimensional structure to the data. This allows separate scales for liberalization and consolidation to be created and combined into a general indicator of democratization. Contrary to expectations in the literature, most central and eastern European countries perform comparatively better than the southern European and Latin American cases. Not only do they reach the same high levels of liberalization and consolidation, but they also do so in a much shorter time span. Furthermore, there is compelling evidence in the Middle Eastern and North African data that the liberalization of autocratic regimes does not always play a democratization triggering role.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a theory of international political budget cycles. I argue that governments attempt to increase their monetary transfers as well as other benefits from international organizations above average levels in the preelection period hoping to appear politically competent to their voters if they improve their country's position during international negotiations. The theory discusses the conditions under which international political budget cycles occur and derives several empirical implications for opportunistic bargaining in the European Union, a region in which international distributional negotiations are highly salient for individuals in 27 member states. A time-series cross sectional analysis of EU member states from 1977-2006 supports the existence of an international political budget cycle and points to the importance of accounting for such cycles when analyzing electoral politics of governments around the globe.},

Specifically, this article draws upon our collective research endeavour to codify the principal questions, issues, and themes that are characteristic of international democracy promotion efforts to date, and to assess what we have learned in terms of further strengthening democracy promotion efforts and therefore global democracy itself.},

 abstract = {Little comparative research has examined territorially motivated cooptation under single-party authoritarianism. I argue that national autocrats in single-party regimes also have incentives to co-opt and control the more economically resourceful but potentially more politically restive subnational regions under economic decentralization and globalization to ease resource extraction and prolong their national rule. In particular, they could take advantage of their personnel monopoly power over the regional government leadership to enlarge the presence of officials governing these regions at a collective decision-making forum within the ruling party, such as its Politburo, where the national autocrats prevail. Consistent with this logic, I find, in the case of China during 1978--2005, that larger, more export-oriented, and to a lesser extent, wealthier provinces---as well as provinces with higher urbanization, centrally administered municipalities, and ethnic minority regions---were on average more likely to be governed by sitting members of the Politburo of the sole governing Chinese Communist Party Central Committees. The findings highlight a hitherto neglected territorial dimension in efforts to explain the relative resilience of authoritarian single-party regimes.},

 abstract = {This paper elaborates a coherent conceptual framework -- a necessary step prior to the development of specific theories and the deduction of hypotheses. Based on previous work on regime changes, it identifies what should be regarded central, peripheral, and distinct regarding political regime and affiliated concepts and rejects several alternative perspectives. The paper suggests how we can systematize our research on regime changes

by distinguishing between different phases and outcomes. Institutional perspectives that focus on both formal and informal institutions and that addresses the complex connection between rules, behaviour and attitudes are found to be the most plausible. The regime definition based on this insight points out four defining principles -- character of rulers, access to power, vertical power limitations, and horizontal power limitations. Moreover, the political-institutional perspective put forward enables researchers to draw systematic distinctions between three crucial dimensions (the rule dimension, the behavioural dimension, and the attitudinal dimension) as well as different phases (transition, installation, and operation) and outcomes of regime changes.},

These coalitions provide the elite collective action underpinning strong states, robust ruling parties, cohesive militaries, and durable authoritarian regimes - all at the same time. Comparative-historical analysis of seven Southeast Asian countries (Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Vietnam, and Thailand) reveals that subtly divergent patterns of contentious politics after World War II provide the best explanation for the dramatic divergence in Southeast Asia's contemporary states and regimes{\dq}--Provided by publisher.},

Using cross-sectional time-series data from 107 developing states between 1960 and 1999, I test the effects of oil wealth on regime failure, political protests, and civil war. I find that oil wealth is robustly associated with increased regime durability, even when controlling for repression, and with lower likelihoods of civil war and antistate protest. I also find that neither the boom nor bust periods exerted any significant effect on regime durability in the states most dependent on exports, even while those states saw more protests during the bust. In short, oil wealth has generally increased the durability ofregimes, and repression does not account for this effect. Future research focused on the origins of robust coalitions in oil-rich states is most likely to provide fruitful explanations to this puzzle.},

 abstract = {This article develops a theory of single-party regime consolidation to explain the dramatic variation in longevity among these regimes. The strength of the opposition and rent scarcity during party consolidation, it argues, structure the choices available to elites as they decide how to build a support base. A weak opposition and ready access to rents makes a low-cost consolidation possible, but these conditions provide little incentive to build a robust coalition or strong party organization; this trajectory generates weak single-party rule that is likely to collapse in a crisis. Conversely, elites who face a powerful opposition and scarce rents have no choice but to offer potential allies access to policy-making and have powerful incentives to build a strong and broad-based party organization. Ruling parties that emerge from initial conditions like these prove more resilient during later crises. The author conducts an initial test of the argument against paired comparisons of Guinea-Bissau and Tanzania and of Indonesia and the Philippines.},

 abstract = {Neopatrimonialism is a concept that has predominately been applied to describe governance in sub-Saharan Africa. Recently, however, it has also been used to describe governance in states from other world regions. However, scholars have rarely attempted systematically to compare neopatrimonial rule in different regional settings. This paper aims to narrow this gap by examining the effect of neopatrimonialism on the tax administration as a core state function in six countries from three different world regions: Argentina, Venezuela, Indonesia, the Philippines, Kenya and Zambia. We conclude that neopatrimonialism is a valuable concept for comparative area studies with the potential to foster dialogue on the `state in operation' across the regional divide. Nevertheless, several indicators are more valid for some world regions than for others. We find that there is no systematic relationship between neopatrimonial trajectories and the strength of tax administration. Individual actor decisions influence the outcomes of neopatrimonialism substantially.},

It examines contemporary authoritarian governance in Egypt and Syria to demonstrate how institutional variations determine why otherwise similar regimes respond differently in adapting their authoritarian systems.

I argue that ``depoliticized'' institutional arenas, as in Egypt, provide a political system greater flexibility than systems with ``politicized'' institutions, as in Syria. By politicized or depoliticized institutions, I mean the degree that a system's institutions such as the presidency, ruling party of state, and military/security services establishment contribute to politically formulating a governing consensus.

The Egyptian case has a higher capacity for authoritarian adaptation because the president oversees a political arena devoid of institutions that can obstruct the executive's initiatives. Conversely, the Syrian president faces a different constraint because too many institutions -including ones that should not be politically active -- are involved in formulating the governing consensus, which makes co-opting elites and non-elites a more diffuse process. It also decreases the system's ability to adapt efficiently.

The argument implies the need for further comparisons of similar authoritarian regimes in order to advance our understanding of authoritarianism.},

explain when and why a regime party becomes an effective tool of authoritarian governance. Three institutional features account for the effectiveness of parties as instruments of authoritarian cooptation: hierarchical assignment of service and benefits, political monopoly over appointments, and selective recruitment and repression. These features of internal party organization accomplish more than distribute rewards in exchange for party members' support of the regime: they effectively exploit the opportunism and career incentives among the population in order to create a stake in the perpetuation of the regime among the most productive and ideologically agreeable segments of the population. However, because the establishment and maintenance of a regime party requires that the ruling elite control and give up significant resources, the feasibility and attractiveness of a regime party as an instrument of authoritarian governance depends on the cost of its chief alternative -- repression. I develop a new formal model of authoritarian regime parties and test its empirical predictions using new data on parties and ruling coalition stability across dictatorships.},

This approach leads tonew insights into the determinants of democratic consolidation that cannot be obtained with existing techniques. I distinguish between democracies that survive because they are consolidated and those democracies that are not consolidated but survive because of some favorable circumstances. As a result, I can identify the determinants of two related yet distinct processes: the likelihood that a democracy consolidates, and the timing of authoritarian reversals in democracies that are not consolidated. I find that the level of economic development, type of democratic executive, and type of authoritarian past determine whether a democracy consolidates, but have no effect on the timing of reversals in democracies that are not consolidated. That risk is only associated with economic recessions. I also find that existing studies greatly underestimate the risk of early reversals while simultaneously overestimating the risk of late reversals, and that a large number of existing democracies are in fact consolidated.},

I argue that the origins of military intervention in politics lie in a fundamental moral hazard problem associated with authoritarian repression. Dictators must deter those who are excluded from power from challenging them. In economically unequal dictatorships, this is best accomplished by employing the military to repress the poor masses. The military exploits this pivotal position by demanding greater institutional autonomy as well as a say in policy, and it threatens to intervene if the civilian leadership departs from a subsequent compromise on these issues. I develop a theoretical model of such contracting on violence and show that the likelihood of military intervention in politics is first increasing and then decreasing in a country's level of economic inequality. I find strong support for these claims when I examine original, large-N data on military intervention.},

Two power-sharing regimes, contested and established dictatorships, may emerge as a result of strategic behavior by the dictator and the ruling coalition. This theory accounts for the large variation in the duration of dictators' tenures and the concentration of power in dictatorships over time, and it contributes to our understanding ofthe dynamics of power sharing and accountability in authoritarian regimes.},

Dictators face threats from the masses over which they rule - the problem of authoritarian control. Secondly from the elites with whom dictators rule - the problem of authoritarian power-sharing. Using the tools of game theory, Svolik explains why some dictators establish personal autocracy and stay in power for decades; why elsewhere leadership changes are regular and institutionalized, as in contemporary China; why some dictatorships are ruled by soldiers, as Uganda was under Idi Amin; why many authoritarian regimes, such as PRI-era Mexico, maintain regime-sanctioned political parties; and why a country's authoritarian past casts a long shadow over its prospects for democracy, as the unfolding events of the Arab Spring reveal. Svolik complements these and other historical case studies with the statistical analysis on institutions, leaders and ruling coalitions across dictatorships from 1946 to 2008{\dq}--},

persistence, and change. It claims a necessity to focus on phenomena

of persistence, rather than stability, in any empirical causal analysis.

Inferences on stability can only be made after the causal relationships

of the three pillars and persistence have been established.

Second, we present an operationalization of three instances of change

in autocratic regimes: change of the ruler; change of the autocratic

subtype; and the transition of autocracy to democracy.

Third, we introduce a new measure of autocratic persistence,

combining the three individual levels.

Finally, we offer some tentative descriptive inference of the empirics of

change in autocracies.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to address two short-comings in the present large-n literature on determinants of democratization: that of partial accounts and of regional confinement. We thus, first, assess the amount of variance in democratization that can be explained by the full range of global determinants suggested in previous studies. Second, we explore the extent to which apparent regional effects can be explained with reference to the global determinants. Using both Freedom House and Polity as democracy indicators, our tests are performed using time-series cross-section data on some 190 countries during the last 30 years. We find that even the most comprehensive models can only explain some 6 percent of the variation in short-term democratization. Moreover, the regional effects, entered as dummies for seven world regions, either disappear once global determinants are controlled for (Freedom House), or add miniscule explanatory power in terms of understanding the dynamics of regime change (Polity). We conclude by discussing alternative implications for future work in the field.},

 abstract = {This article provides an overview of recent developments in historical institutionalism. First, it reviews some distinctions that are commonly drawn between the ``historical'' and the ``rational choice'' variants of institutionalism and shows that there are more points of tangency than typically assumed. However, differences remain in how scholars in the two traditions approach empirical problems. The contrast of rational choice's emphasis on institutions as coordination mechanisms that generate or sustain equilibria versus historical institutionalism's emphasis on how institutions emerge from and are embedded in concrete temporal processes serves as the foundation for the second half of the essay, which assesses our progress in understanding institutional formation and change. Drawing on insights from recent historical institutional work on ``critical junctures'' and on ``policy feedbacks,'' the article proposes a way of thinking about institutional evolution and path dependency that provides an alternative to equilibrium and other approaches that separate the analysis of institutional stability from that of institutional change.},

With striking historical scope and command of the literature of many disciplines, this book seeks the common cause of these events in collective violence. In collective violence, social interaction immediately inflicts physical damage, involves at least two perpetrators of damage, and results in part from coordination among the persons who perform the damaging acts. Professor Tilly argues that collective violence is complicated, changeable, and unpredictable in some regards - yet that it also results from similar causes variously combined in different times and places.



Pinpointing the causes, combinations, and settings helps to explain collective violence and its variations and also helps to identify the best ways to mitigate violence and create democracies with a minimum of damage to persons and property.{\dq}--Jacket.},

Countries with Protestant traditions, histories of British rule, more developed economies, and (probably) higher imports were less `corrupt'. Federal states were more `corrupt'.

Quite strong evidence suggests that highly developed, long-established liberal democracies, with a free and widely read press, a high share of women in government, and a history of openness to trade, are perceived as less corrupt. Countries that depend on fuel exports or have intrusive business regulations and unpredictable inflation are judged more corrupt. Although the causal direction is usually unclear, instrumenting with income as of 1700 suggests higher development does cause lower perceived corruption. However, controlling for income, most factors that predict perceived corruption do not correlate with recently available measures of actual corruption experiences (based on surveys of business people and citizens that ask whether they have been expected to pay bribes recently). Reported corruption experiences correlate with lower development, and possibly with dependence on fuel exports, lower trade openness, and more intrusive regulations. The subjective data may reflect opinion rather than experience, and future research could usefully focus on experience-based indicators.},

By contrast, in illiberal democracies and competitive autocracies, leaders are often thought to boost their popularity by exploiting nationalism, exaggerating external threats, andmanipulating the media.Using time-series data, I examine the determinants of presidential approval in Russia since 1991, a period in which leaders' ratings swung between extremes. I find that Yeltsin's and Putin's ratings were, in fact, closely linked to public perceptions of economic performance, which, in turn, reflected objective economic indicators. Although media manipulation, wars, terrorist attacks, and other events also mattered, Putin's unprecedented popularity and the decline in Yeltsin's are well explained by the contrasting economic circumstances over which each presided.},

Moreover, analysts sometimes offer contradictory advice for such selection. This article provides a game-theoretic explanation of these phenomena. Six different game-theoretic scenarios lead to the same equilibrium outcome. This is a mixed strategy equilibrium. The success ratio is the outcome of the selection of mixed strategies by both sender and receiver countries. Under a wide range of (specified) circumstances, the size of the sanction has no impact upon the behavior of the target country. Finally, some empirical implications of the game-theoretic analysis are compared to existing empirical generalizations, and further implications for empirical research are discussed.},

@article{Ulfelder.2005,
 abstract = {Prior research indicates that different types of authoritarian regimes break down in different ways because key cadres in those regimes have different interests and face different strategic environments.

Building on that theoretical foundation, I use event history models to examine the effects of contentious collective action on the likelihood of authoritarian breakdown. This analysis shows that some kinds of autocracy are more vulnerable to breakdown in the wake of contentious events than others, and that the strength and direction of this effect varies not only across types of authoritarianism, but across forms of collective action as well.},

 abstract = {Does natural-resource wealth impede transitions to democracy? This article revisits this question with an event history design that differs from the approach used in other recent statistical tests of rentier state theory. The research confirms that autocracy is typically more durable in countries with substantial resource wealth, and the author finds this effect is robust to other measures proposed to explain the dearth of democracy in the Middle East or the Muslim world. Along the way, the author raises concerns about the use of all-countries and all-years samples to test theories of democratization, arguing that this design can obscure important differences in the forces driving stability and change among different types of political regimes.},

Diese Auffassung stellen wir aus der Perspektive derHumanentwicklung in Frage. Aus dieser Perspektive istDemokratisierung ein prim{\"a}r emanzipatorischer Vorgang, dessenHaupttriebfeder entsprechende emanzipatorische Kr{\"a}fte in der Bev{\"o}lkerung sein sollten.Wir messen diese emanzipatorischen Kr{\"a}fte mit Freiheitspr{\"a}ferenzen und verwendenDaten aus denWertestudienumzu zeigen, dass die Freiheitspr{\"a}ferenzen der B{\"u}rger in derTat einen positiven Einfluss auf die demokratische Entwicklung ihres Landes haben. Kein anderer Faktor -- weder {\"o}konomische Entwicklung noch soziales Kapital -- kann den Effekt der Freiheitspr{\"a}ferenzen auf die demokratische Entwicklung verdr{\"a}ngen.Daraus folgern wir, dass die Perspektive derHumanentwicklung dasAugenmerk auf emanzipatorische Kr{\"a}fte lenkt, die in derTransitionsforschung bislang vernachl{\"a}ssigt wurden.},

 abstract = {This article addresses the conceptual challenges involved in mapping political regimes. The first section offers a critique of regime typologies that adopt a uni-dimensional approach to differentiating between political regimes. The second section shows why a two-dimensional typology is better grounded in liberal democratic theory as well as for analytically grasping the empirical variation between political regimes and regime change. The penultimate section proposes a classificatory scheme on the basis of a clear set of defining attributes of the two constitutive dimensions of liberal democracy -- electoralism and constitutionalism. Equipped with this two-dimensional classificatory device the article proceeds in the last section to propose a regime typology with four main types of regime: democratic, constitutional-oligarchic, electoral-autocratic, and authoritarian. This provides a conceptual map in which the categories and subcategories developed by the literature on hybrid regimes can be located and analytically related to each other. The last section further divides the category of democratic regimes into four subtypes: liberal, constitutional, electoral, and limited.},

 abstract = {Many scholars claim that democracy improves population health. The prevailing explanation for this is that democratic regimes distribute health-promoting resources more widely than autocratic regimes. The central contention of this article is that democracies also have a significant pro-health effect regardless of public redistributive policies. After establishing the theoretical plausibility of the nondistributive effect, a panel of 153 countries for the years 1972 to 2000 is used to examine the relationship between extent of democratic experience and life expectancy. The authors find that democratic governance continues to have a salutary effect on population health even when controls are introduced for the distribution of health-enhancing resources. Data for fifty autocratic countries for the years 1994 to 2007 are then used to examine whether media freedom---independent of government responsiveness---has a positive impact on life expectancy.},

 abstract = {I use basic tools of economic theory to construct a simple model of the behavior of dictatorships. Two extreme cases are considered: a {\dq}tin-pot{\dq} dictatorship, in which the dictator wishes only to minimize the costs of remaining in power in order to collect the fruits of office (palaces, Mercedes-Benzes, Swiss bank accounts), and a {\dq}totalitarian{\dq} dictatorship, whose leader maximizes power over the population. I show that the two differ in their responses to economic change. For example, a decline in economic performance will lead a tin-pot regime to increase its repression of the population, whereas it will lead a totalitarian government to reduce repression. The model also shows why military dictatorships (a subspecies of tin-pots) tend to be short-lived and often voluntarily hand power over to a civilian regime; explains numerous features of totalitarian regimes; and suggests what policies will enable democratic regimes to deal with dictatorships effectively.},

@article{Wood.2008,
 abstract = {While intended as a nonviolent foreign policy alternative to military intervention, sanctions have often worsened humanitarian and human rights conditions in the target country. This article examines the relationship between economic sanctions and state-sponsored repression of human rights. Drawing on both the public choice and institutional constraints literature, I argue that the imposition of economic sanctions negatively impacts human rights conditions in the target state by encouraging incumbents to increase repression. Specifically, sanctions threaten the stability of target incumbents, leading them to augment their level of repression in an effort to stabilize the regime, protect core supporters, minimize the threat posed by potential challengers, and suppress popular dissent. The empirical results support this theory. These findings provide further evidence that sanctions impose political, social, and physical hardship on civilian populations. They also underscore a need for improvements in current strategies and mechanisms by which states pursue foreign-policy goals and the international community enforces international law and stability.},

 abstract = {This book develops a manipulationist theory of causation and explanation: causal and explanatory relationships are relationships that are potentially exploitable for purposes of manipulation and control. The resulting theory is a species of counterfactual theory that (I claim) avoids the difficulties and counterexamples that have infected alternative accounts of causation and explanation, from the Deductive-Nomological model onwards. One of the key concepts in this theory is the notion of an intervention, which is an idealization of the notion of an experimental manipulation that is stripped of its anthropocentric elements. This notion is used to provide a characterization of causal relationships that is non-reductive but also not viciously circular. Relationships that correctly tell us how the value of one variable Y would change under interventions on a second variable Y are invariant. The notion of an invariant relationship is more helpful than the notion of a law of nature (the notion on which philosophers have traditionally relied) in understanding how explanation and causal attribution work in the special sciences.},

The promise of higher aid if the country democratizes only provides an incentive for democratization for political leaders who expect to remain in office after democratization occurs. I show that dictators with large distributional coalitions, who have a good chance of winning fair elections, tend to respond to aid by democratizing. In contrast, aid helps dictators with the smallest distributional coalitions hang on to power. I present a model that shows a dictator's decision calculus, given different a priori support coalitions and varying degrees of aid conditionality, and test the model implications with data from 190 authoritarian regimes in 101 countries from 1960 to 2002.},

@article{Zakaria.1997,
 abstract = {Summary: Around the world, democratically elected regimes are routinely ignoring limits on their power and depriving citizens of basic freedoms. From Peru to the Philippines, we see the rise of a disturbing phenomenon: illiberal democracy. It has been difficult to recognize because for the last century in the West, democracy -- free and fair elections -- has gone hand in hand with constitutional liberalism -- the rule of law and basic human rights. But in the rest of the world, these two concepts are coming apart. Democracy without constitutional liberalism is producing centralized regimes, the erosion of

liberty, ethnic competition, conflict, and war. The international community and the United States must end their obsession with balloting and promote the gradual liberalization of societies.},

This paper proposes an answer by constructing and analyzing an original dataset drawn from the German parliament's own voluminous record of election disputes for every parliamentary election in the life of Imperial Germany (1871-1912) after its adoption of universal male suffrage in 1871. The paper analyzes the election of over 5,000 parliamentary seats to identify where and why elections were disputed as a result of procedural manipulation, undue influence, and coercion. Motivated by the proposition that the practice of elections is affected by the informal structure of authority, the paper tests the argument that elections are more likely to be subject to ``electoral misconduct'' when introduced into settings with high socio-economic inequality. The paper demonstrates that landholding inequality---the hallmark of traditional social power---is significantly related to the incidence of electoral fraud, even controlling for other frequently cited factors including the nature of electoral institutions and the competitiveness of elections.},
