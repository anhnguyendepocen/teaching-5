# Who am I?

- **Orientation**: (Computationalish) Political Scientist
- **Position**: Research Fellow, Chair of Comparative Politics
- **Fields**: Autocracy, Contentious Politics, and Applied Methods
- **Secret weakness**: Zero intuition for maths & statistics

\begin{block}{\textbf{Introductory Round}}
  So, who are you? Mind to fill us in on your secret weakness?
\end{block}

# Anyways, what is $\mathcal{R}$?

- open-source programming language and environment
- purpose: statistical computing and graphics
- written by Robert Gentleman & Ross Ihaka (Auckland, NZ)
- cross-plattform (UNIX, Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, MacOS)
- one of the most popular programming languages

# Why bother with $\mathcal{R}$?

- **Popular**
    - Large community to turn to for help
    - New statistical routines often first implemented in R
- **Data wrangling**
    - powerful tools for handling, cleaning and exploring data
- **Data vizualization**
    - powerful, flexible, and easy plotting (unlike S....)
- **Open source**
    - free for teachers, students, and everyone else
    - huge & active community of developers
    - tons and tons and tons of free material
    - free multi-core support (unlike S....)
    
# Goals of this workshop

1. Provide a grand tour of elementary $\mathcal{R}$
    - Basic (probabilistic) programming
    - Elementary data management
    - Introduction to ggplot2
    - Applied regression & working with regression results
2. Introduce self-help strategies
    - Diagnose error messages
    - Find *relevant* resources
    - Ask a good question
3. Promote interest, because  $\mathcal{R} \approx$ Fun

# Install & Open R

- If you brought your own computer
    - Download R from https://cran.r-project.org/ & install
    - Download RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/ & install
- Open RStudio.

# A first glance at RStudio

# Let's take $\mathcal{R}$ for a ride.

See if you can solve the following problems.

1. $2 + 2$
2. $-3 \cdot 9$
3. $\sqrt[3]{8}$ (Hint: $\sqrt[3]{8} = 8^\frac{1}{3}$)
4. $(2 + 3) \cdot 8$ 
5. $\mathcal{R}$ ships with an extensive online
  documentation. For instance, it includes a manual named
  ``An Introduction to R''.[^1] Use the RStudio help pane
  to locate this manual.

[^1]: Note that the title doesn't say "gentle".
  
# What did we just learn?

1. You can interact with $\mathcal{R}$ from the console.
    - $>$: $\mathcal{R}$ is waiting for input.
    - $+$: Your command is incomplete.
    - Error: Something went wrong.
2. $\mathcal{R}$ is a super-charged calculator
  which supports almost everything you can imagine.
3. An elementary way to get help on $\mathcal{R}$ is to ask
  $\mathcal{R}$.[^2]
    a. ?"+" - Opens the help page on arithmetic operators.
    b. help("+") - Same here.
    c. ??Regression - Conducts a keyword search for "Regression".

[^2]: Quotation marks are mandatory for operators (e.g., +) and control statements (e.g., if).
